S-9: But not only just that, we will start to think about how we can start to develop a symbiotic relationship with biology.
S-8: Wouldn't it be great if you could take these artificial biological cells and fuse them with biological ones to correct problems that we couldn't really deal with?
S-7: The real issue in cellular biology is we are never going to understand everything, because it's a multidimensional problem put there by evolution.
S-6: Evolution cannot be cut apart.
S-5: You need to somehow find the fitness function.
S-4: And the profound realization for me is that, if this works, the concept of the selfish gene gets kicked up a level, and we really start talking about selfish matter.

S-6: I used to be much bigger, much more muscular.
S-5: And so I ended up walking like this.
S-4: I looked a lot like an orangutan, our close cousins, or the Incredible Hulk.

S-9: Models are not static.

S-7: So an example might be, if you go back 100 years ago when electricity was first becoming common, there were a lot of fears about it.
S-6: I mean, there were people who were afraid to push doorbells, because there was electricity in there, and that was dangerous.
S-5: For us, we're very facile around electricity.
S-4: We change light bulbs without even thinking about it.
S-3: Our model of security around electricity is something we were born into.

S-9: Both parties know exactly what the speaker means, and the speaker knows the listener knows that the speaker knows that the listener knows, etc., etc.
S-8: So what's going on?
S-7: I think the key idea is that language is a way of negotiating relationships, and human relationships fall into a number of types.
S-6: There's an influential taxonomy by the anthropologist Alan Fiske, in which relationships can be categorized, more or less, into communality, which works on the principle "what's mine is thine, what's thine is mine," the kind of mindset that operates within a family, for example; dominance, whose principle is "don't mess with me;" reciprocity, "you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours;" and sexuality, in the immortal words of Cole Porter, "Let's do it."
S-5: Now, relationship types can be negotiated.
S-4: Even though there are default situations in which one of these mindsets can be applied, they can be stretched and extended.
S-3: For example, communality applies most naturally within family or friends, but it can be used to try to transfer the mentality of sharing to groups that ordinarily would not be disposed to exercise it.
S-2: For example, in brotherhoods, fraternal organizations, sororities, locutions like "the family of man," you try to get people who are not related to use the relationship type that would ordinarily be appropriate to close kin.
S-1: Now, mismatches -- when one person assumes one relationship type, and another assumes a different one -- can be awkward.
S: If you went over and you helped yourself to a shrimp off your boss' plate, for example, that would be an awkward situation.

S-5: So how do we look at this question experimentally?
S-4: We asked people to build some origami.
S-3: We gave them instructions on how to create origami, and we gave them a sheet of paper.

S-6: I am more invulnerable than Achilles; fortune hath not one place to hit me."
S-5: What kind of remarkable machinery does this guy have in his head?
S-4: Well, it turns out it's precisely the same remarkable machinery that all off us have.
S-3: Human beings have something that we might think of as a "psychological immune system."
S-2: A system of cognitive processes, largely non-conscious cognitive processes, that help them change their views of the world, so that they can feel better about the worlds in which they find themselves.

S-7: The AI people said, well, the thing in the box is a programmable computer because that's equivalent to a brain, and we'll feed it some inputs and we'll get it to do something, have some behavior.
S-6: And Alan Turing defined the Turing test, which is essentially saying, we'll know if something's intelligent if it behaves identical to a human.
S-5: A behavioral metric of what intelligence is, and this has stuck in our minds for a long period of time.
S-4: Reality though, I call it real intelligence.
S-3: Real intelligence is built on something else.
S-2: We experience the world through a sequence of patterns, and we store them, and we recall them. And when we recall them, we match them up against reality, and we're making predictions all the time.

S-6: And they said, "Jeez, you know, we think we could actually take a look at the slope of the Doppler effect to figure out the points at which the satellite is closest to our antennae and the points at which it's farthest away.

S-7: Same concept, but looking at communication dynamics in a very different sphere.
S-6: And so fundamentally, rather than, for example, measuring content based on how many people are watching, this gives us the basic data for looking at engagement properties of content.
S-5: And just like we can look at feedback cycles and dynamics in a family, we can now open up the same concepts and look at much larger groups of people.
S-4: This is a subset of data from our database -- just 50,000 out of several million -- and the social graph that connects them through publicly available sources.

S-6: This is indeed important, because everyone understands that there is some sort of limit on how many people we can be on this planet.
S-5: And there are some people who say that the world population is growing like this -- three billion in 1960, seven billion just last year -- and it will continue to grow because there are religions that stop women from having few babies, and it may continue like this.

S-4: So the idea was that we would be working on whatever we're working on, at 2:30 p.m. the students flow in and you put down what you're doing, or you trade, or you work a little bit later or whatever it is.
S-3: You give those hours in the afternoon to the students in the neighborhood.

S-8: But for scientists, also the rings have a special meaning, because we believe they represent, on a small scale, how the Solar System actually formed.
S-7: Some of the scientists believe that the way the Solar System formed, that the Sun when it collapsed and actually created the Sun, a lot of the dust around it created rings and then the particles in those rings accumulated together, and they formed bigger rocks, and then that's how the planets, you know, were formed.
S-6: So, the idea is, by watching Saturn we're actually watching our solar system in real time being formed on a smaller scale, so it's like a test bed for it.

S-10: Now gamma imaging has been around for a long time to image the heart, and it had even been tried to image the breast.
S-9: But the problem was that the gamma detectors were these huge, bulky tubes, and they were filled with these scintillating crystals, and you just couldn't get them close enough around the breast to find small tumors.
S-8: But the potential advantage was that gamma rays, unlike X-rays, are not influenced by breast density.
S-7: But this technology could not find tumors when they're small, and finding a small tumor is critical for survival.
S-6: If you can find a tumor when it's less than a centimeter, survival exceeds 90 percent, but drops off rapidly as tumor size increases.
S-5: But Michael told me about a new type of gamma detector that he'd seen, and this is it.
S-4: It's made not of a bulky tube, but of a thin layer of a semiconductor material that serves as the gamma detector.
S-3: And I started talking to him about this problem with breast density, and we realized that we might be able to get this detector close enough around the breast to actually find small tumors.
S-2: So after putting together a grid of these cubes with tape -- -- Michael hacked off the X-ray plate of a mammography machine that was about to be thrown out, and we attached the new detector, and we decided to call this machine Molecular Breast Imaging, or MBI.

S-5: And yet, that's a really important practical view of the world.
S-4: So one of the roadblocks we have in moving this agenda forward is exams.
S-3: In the end, if we test everyone by hand in exams, it's kind of hard to get the curricula changed to a point where they can use computers during the semesters.
S-2: And one of the reasons it's so important -- so it's very important to get computers in exams.

S-8: He eventually enlisted the help of this amazing other figure, who's kind of the other protagonist of the book -- this guy, Henry Whitehead, who was a local minister, who was not at all a man of science, but was incredibly socially connected; he knew everybody in the neighborhood.
S-7: And he managed to track down, Whitehead did, many of the cases of people who had drunk water from the pump, or who hadn't drunk water from the pump.
S-6: And eventually Snow made a map of the outbreak.
S-5: He found increasingly that people who drank from the pump were getting sick.
S-4: People who hadn't drunk from the pump were not getting sick.
S-3: And he thought about representing that as a kind of a table of statistics of people living in different neighborhoods, people who hadn't, you know, percentages of people who hadn't, but eventually he hit upon the idea that what he needed was something that you could see.
S-2: Something that would take in a sense a higher-level view of all this activity that had been happening in the neighborhood.
S-1: And so he created this map, which basically ended up representing all the deaths in the neighborhoods as black bars at each address.

S-8: Absolutely, exquisitely minute, and yet we've discovered pretty much the full set.
S-7: So, one of my most illustrious forebears at Manchester University, Ernest Rutherford, discoverer of the atomic nucleus, once said, "All science is either physics or stamp collecting."
S-6: Now, I don't think he meant to insult the rest of science, although he was from New Zealand, so it's possible.
S-5: But what he meant was that what we've done, really, is stamp collect there.
S-4: OK, we've discovered the particles, but unless you understand the underlying reason for that pattern -- you know, why it's built the way it is -- really you've done stamp collecting. You haven't done science.
S-3: Fortunately, we have probably one of the greatest scientific achievements of the twentieth century that underpins that pattern.

S-7: And if you look at a galaxy even farther away, it would be moving away faster.
S-6: So we say the universe is expanding.
S-5: What that means, of course, is that, in the past, things were closer together.
S-4: In the past, the universe was more dense, and it was also hotter.
S-3: If you squeeze things together, the temperature goes up.
S-2: That kind of makes sense to us.

S-7: 1954, he wrote a book called "The Real Enjoyment of Living," and he suggested that happiness is not about having what you want; instead, it's about wanting what you have.
S-6: Or in other words, I think the Bhutanese believe happiness equals wanting what you have -- imagine gratitude -- divided by having what you want -- gratification.
S-5: The Bhutanese aren't on some aspirational treadmill, constantly focused on what they don't have.

S-3: How many of us here, as TEDsters in the audience, spend more of our time in the bottom half of this equation, in the denominator?

S-7: And the answer is: it is at least partially fair.

Let's bring advanced technology into the apartment, technology-enabled infill, give people the tools within this open-loft chassis to go through a process of defining what their needs and values and activities are, and then a matching algorithm will match a unique assembly of integrated infill components, furniture, and cabinetry, that are personalized to that individual, and they give them the tools to go through the process and to refine it, and it's something like working with an architect, where the dialogue starts when you give an alternative to a person to react to.

S-10: Why not leverage the learnings that you've been learning your entire life?
S-9: So Virtual Earth is about starting off creating the first digital representation, comprehensive, of the entire world.
S-8: What we want to do is mix in all types of data.
S-7: Tag it. Attribute it. Metadata. Get the community to add local depth, global perspective, local knowledge.
S-6: So when you think about this problem, what an enormous undertaking. Where do you begin?
S-5: Well, we collect data from satellites, from airplanes, from ground vehicles, from people.
S-4: This process is an engineering problem, a mechanical problem, a logistical problem, an operational problem.
S-3: Here is an example of our aerial camera.
S-2: This is panchromatic. It's actually four color cones.
S-1: In addition, it's multi-spectral.
S: We collect four gigabits per second of data, if you can imagine that kind of data stream coming down.

S-10: And it turns out once again that spectral sensitivity is very important here.
S-9: In all of these examples, I think, we should start making the light out of darkness, and use the darkness as a canvas -- like the visual artists do, like Edward Hopper in this painting.
S-8: I think that there is a lot of suspense in this painting.
S-7: I think, when I see it, I start to think, who are those people?
S-6: Where have they come from? Where are they going?
S-5: What just happened? What will be happening in the next five minutes?
S-4: And it only embodies all these stories and all this suspense because of the darkness and the light.
S-3: Edward Hopper was a real master in creating the narration by working with light and dark.
S-2: And we can learn from that and create more interesting and inspiring architectural environments.
S-1: We can do that in commercial spaces like this.
S: And you can still also go outside and enjoy the greatest show in the universe, which is, of course, the universe itself.

S-10: This is my wife and I cooking breakfast in the kitchen, and as we move through space and through time, a very everyday pattern of life in the kitchen.
S-9: In order to convert this opaque, 90,000 hours of video into something that we could start to see, we use motion analysis to pull out, as we move through space and through time, what we call space-time worms.
S-8: And this has become part of our toolkit for being able to look and see where the activities are in the data, and with it, trace the pattern of, in particular, where my son moved throughout the home, so that we could focus our transcription efforts, all of the speech environment around my son -- all of the words that he heard from myself, my wife, our nanny, and over time, the words he began to produce.
S-7: So with that technology and that data and the ability to, with machine assistance, transcribe speech, we've now transcribed well over seven million words of our home transcripts.
S-6: And with that, let me take you now for a first tour into the data.
S-5: So you've all, I'm sure, seen time-lapse videos where a flower will blossom as you accelerate time.
S-4: I'd like you to now experience the blossoming of a speech form.
S-3: My son, soon after his first birthday, would say "gaga" to mean water.
S-2: And over the course of the next half-year, he slowly learned to approximate the proper adult form, "water."

S-9: They are called neurons.
S-8: They send little pulses of electricity down their processes to each other, and where they contact each other, those little pulses of electricity can jump from one neuron to the other.
S-7: That process is called a synapse.
S-6: You've got this huge network of cells interacting with each other -- about 100 million of them, sending about 10 quadrillion of these pulses around every second.
S-5: And that's basically what's going on in your brain right now as you're watching this.
S-4: How does that compare with the way computers work?
S-3: In the computer, you have all the data going through the central processing unit, and any piece of data basically has to go through that bottleneck, whereas in the brain, what you have is these neurons, and the data just really flows through a network of connections among the neurons. There's no bottleneck here.
S-2: It's really a network in the literal sense of the word.

S-6: Just to try and get an assessment of what our gene repertoire was, we assembled all the data -- including all of ours thus far from the expedition, which represents more than half of all the gene data on the planet -- and it totaled around 29 million genes.
S-5: And we tried to put these into gene families to see what these discoveries are: Are we just discovering new members of known families, or are we discovering new families?
S-4: And it turns out we have about 50,000 major gene families, but every new sample we take in the environment adds in a linear fashion to these new families.
S-3: So we're at the earliest stages of discovery about basic genes, components and life on this planet.
S-2: When we look at the so-called evolutionary tree, we're up on the upper right-hand corner with the animals.
S-1: Of those roughly 29 million genes, we only have around 24,000 in our genome.

S-7: You call your friend, she puts her handset in a robot, and, bam! You're a MeBot -- you can make eye contact, you can talk with your friends, you can move around, you can gesture -- maybe the next best thing to really being there, or is it?
S-6: To explore this question, my student, Siggy Adalgeirsson, did a study where we brought human participants, people, into our lab to do a collaborative task with a remote collaborator.
S-5: The task involved things like looking at a set of objects on the table, discussing them in terms of their importance and relevance to performing a certain task -- this ended up being a survival task -- and then rating them in terms of how valuable and important they thought they were.
S-4: The remote collaborator was an experimenter from our group who used one of three different technologies to interact with the participants.
S-3: The first was just the screen.

S-7: And that's not only true in this country, it is true all over the world.
S-6: Bread has migrated to tropical countries, where the middle classes now eat French rolls and hamburgers and where the commuters find bread much more handy to use than rice or cassava.
S-5: So bread has become from a main staple, a source of calories associated with obesity and also a source of modernity, of modern life.
S-4: And the whiter the bread, in many countries, the better it is.
S-3: So this is the story of bread as we know it now.
S-2: But of course the price of mass production has been that we moved large-scale.

S-4: There aren't a lot of good words for the concepts we're going to talk about.

S-4: One example would be, people fear kidnapping by strangers when the data supports kidnapping by relatives is much more common.
S-3: This is for children.
S-2: Third, personified risks are perceived to be greater than anonymous risks -- so Bin Laden is scarier because he has a name.

S-9: And that is the species of organism that is responsible for causing cholera.
S-8: And the reason I thought this is a really great organism to look at is that we understand why it's so harmful.
S-7: It's harmful because it produces a toxin, and that toxin is released when the organism gets into our intestinal tract.
S-6: It causes fluid to flow from the cells that line our intestine into the lumen, the internal chamber of our intestine, and then that fluid goes the only way it can, which is out the other end.
S-5: And it flushes out thousands of different other competitors that would otherwise make life difficult for the Vibrios.
S-4: So what happens, if you've got an organism, it produces a lot of toxin.
S-3: After a few days of infection you end up having -- the fecal material really isn't so disgusting as we might imagine.

S-7: So what we do is we give you another word, one for which the system does know the answer.
S-6: We don't tell you which one's which, and we say, please type both.
S-5: And if you type the correct word for the one for which the system already knows the answer, it assumes you are human, and it also gets some confidence that you typed the other word correctly.
S-4: And if we repeat this process to like 10 different people and all of them agree on what the new word is, then we get one more word digitized accurately.

S-8: There is no longer any consistency in the surface signals.
S-7: Our breakthrough was to create an algorithm that unfolds the cortex, so that we can map the signals closer to its source, and therefore making it capable of working across a mass population.
S-6: The second challenge is the actual device for observing brainwaves.
S-5: EEG measurements typically involve a hairnet with an array of sensors, like the one that you can see here in the photo.

S-7: Because you still have 80 percent of the traffic.
S-6: Now, that's also wrong, because traffic happens to be a nonlinear phenomenon, meaning that once you reach above a certain capacity threshold then congestion starts to increase really, really rapidly.
S-5: But fortunately, it also works the other way around.
S-4: If you can reduce traffic even somewhat, then congestion will go down much faster than you might think.

S-8: The equator's speed is actually about 60 miles per hour.
S-7: There are four on-board micro-controllers that, each time this ring rotates it, as it passes the rear of the display, it picks up a position signal.
S-6: And from that, the on-board micro-controllers can extrapolate the position of the ring at all points around the revolution and display arbitrary bitmap images and animations.
S-5: But this is really just the beginning.
S-4: In addition to higher resolution versions of this display, my father and I are working on a new patent-pending design for a fully volumetric display using the same phenomenon.
S-3: It achieves this by rotating LEDs about two axes.
S-2: So as you can see here, this is a, eleven-inch diameter circuit board.

S-6: Now wall switches, we all know, fail.
S-5: But our friends who are condensed matter physicists managed to come up, some 50 years ago, with a very nice device, shown under that bell jar, which is a transistor.
S-4: A transistor is nothing more than a wall switch.
S-3: It turns things on and off, but it does so without moving parts and it doesn't fail, basically, for a very long period of time.
S-2: So the second layer of simplicity was the transistor in the Internet.

S-4: They remind us that we all have nerd power.
S-3: Sometimes we just forget.

S-5: Well, at some level, we think all of these things should work.
S-4: So, is that sufficient? If we think they should work intuitively, should we go for them?
S-3: Well, in business, that's certainly not the way we would go about it.

S-7: These tools of creativity have become tools of speech.
S-6: It is a literacy for this generation. This is how our kids speak.
S-5: It is how our kids think. It is what your kids are as they increasingly understand digital technologies and their relationship to themselves.
S-4: Now, in response to this new use of culture using digital technologies, the law has not greeted this Sousa revival with very much common sense.
S-3: Instead, the architecture of copyright law and the architecture of digital technologies, as they interact, have produced the presumption that these activities are illegal.
S-2: Because if copyright law at its core regulates something called copies, then in the digital world the one fact we can't escape is that every single use of culture produces a copy.

S-2: It was an amazingly smelly city. Not just because of the cesspools, but also the sheer number of livestock in the city would shock people.

S-5: This could totally revamp the pesticide industries throughout the world.
S-4: You could fly 100 Ph.D. students under the umbrella of this concept, because my supposition is that entomopathogenic fungi, prior to sporulation, attract the very insects that are otherwise repelled by those spores.
S-3: And so I came up with a Life Box, because I needed a delivery system.
S-2: The Life Box -- you're gonna be getting a DVD of the TED conference -- you add soil, you add water, you have mycorrhizal and endophytic fungi as well as spores, like of the Agarikon mushroom.

S-9: To me, as an international lawyer, this scared me far more than any of the creatures or the monsters we may have seen, for it belies the notion that you can actually protect the ocean, the global ocean, that provides us all with carbon storage, with heat storage, with oxygen, if you can only protect 36 percent.
S-8: This is indeed the true heart of the planet.
S-7: Some of the problems that we have to confront are that the current international laws -- for example, shipping -- provide more protection to the areas closest to shore.
S-6: For example, garbage discharge, something you would think just simply goes away, but the laws regulating ship discharge of garbage actually get weaker the further you are from shore.
S-5: As a result, we have garbage patches the size of twice-Texas.
S-4: It's unbelievable.
S-3: We used to think the solution to pollution was dilution, but that has proved to be no longer the case.
S-2: So what we have learned from social scientists and economists like Elinor Ostrom, who are studying the phenomenon of management of the commons on a local scale, is that there are certain prerequisites that you can put into place that enable you to manage and access open space for the good of one and all.

S-2: And then the way that you process that data to get a result is that you translate this pattern of activity into a new pattern of activity, just by it flowing through the network.

S-9: And if I had to pick a group that I think is our Invisible College, is our generation's collection of people trying to take these tools and to press it into service, not for more arguments, but for better arguments, I'd pick the open-source programmers.
S-8: Programming is a three-way relationship between a programmer, some source code, and the computer it's meant to run on, but computers are such famously inflexible interpreters of instructions that it's extraordinarily difficult to write out a set of instructions that the computer knows how to execute, and that's if one person is writing it.
S-7: Once you get more than one person writing it, it's very easy for any two programmers to overwrite each other's work if they're working on the same file, or to send incompatible instructions that simply causes the computer to choke, and this problem grows larger the more programmers are involved.
S-6: To a first approximation, the problem of managing a large software project is the problem of keeping this social chaos at bay.
S-5: Now, for decades there has been a canonical solution to this problem, which is to use something called a "version control system," and a version control system does what is says on the tin.
S-4: It provides a canonical copy of the software on a server somewhere.
S-3: The only programmers who can change it are people who've specifically been given permission to access it, and they're only allowed to access the sub-section of it that they have permission to change.
S-2: And when people draw diagrams of version control systems, the diagrams always look something like this.

S-8: So, when we did this for responses from the standard method and from our encoder and transducer.
S-7: So let me show you, and I'm going to start with the standard method first.
S-6: So you can see that it's pretty limited, and because the firing patterns aren't in the right code, they're very limited in what they can tell you about what's out there. So you can see that there's something there, but it's not so clear what that something is, and this just sort of circles back to what I was saying in the beginning, that with the standard method, patients can see high-contrast edges, they can see light, but it doesn't easily go further than that. So what was the image? It was a baby's face.
S-5: So what about with our approach, adding the code? And you can see that it's much better. Not only can you tell that it's a baby's face, but you can tell that it's this baby's face, which is a really challenging task.
S-4: So on the left is the encoder alone, and on the right is from an actual blind retina, so the encoder and the transducer.
S-3: But the key one really is the encoder alone, because we can team up the encoder with the different transducer.
S-2: This is just actually the first one that we tried.

S-4: But almost no malaria experts even know it exists.
S-3: This is important, because it tells us that if you have moderate biting densities, you can eradicate malaria by mosquito proofing houses.

S-6: Half the people who developed the food pyramid have ties to agribusiness.
S-5: So, instead of substituting plants for animals, our swollen appetites simply became larger, and the most dangerous aspects of them remained unchanged.
S-4: So-called low-fat diets, so-called low-carb diets -- these are not solutions.

S-7: The point of this story is that trusting too much in the feeling of being on the correct side of anything can be very dangerous.
S-6: This internal sense of rightness that we all experience so often is not a reliable guide to what is actually going on in the external world.
S-5: And when we act like it is, and we stop entertaining the possibility that we could be wrong, well that's when we end up doing things like dumping 200 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico, or torpedoing the global economy.

S-7: So what I did hear, once in a while, was that people wanted a loan -- I thought that sounded very reasonable and really exciting.
S-6: And by the way, I was a philosophy and poetry major in school, so I didn't know the difference between profit and revenue when I went to East Africa.
S-5: I just got this impression that the money would work.
S-4: And my introduction to business was in these $100 little infuses of capital.
S-3: And I learned about profit and revenue, about leverage, all sorts of things, from farmers, from seamstresses, from goat herders.
S-2: So this idea that these new stories of business and hope might be shared with my friends and family, and through that, maybe we could get some of the money that they needed to be able to continue their businesses as loans, that's this little idea that turned into Kiva.

S-6: And what a wonderful thing it is.
S-5: Now most pollinators that we think about are insects, but actually in the tropics, many birds and butterflies pollinate.
S-4: And many of the tropical flowers are red, and that's because butterflies and birds see similarly to us, we think, and can see the color red very well.
S-3: But if you look at the spectrum, birds and us, we see red, green and blue and see that spectrum.

S-9: And this is visible in the unstoppable change in language -- the fact that by the time the Academy finishes their dictionary, it will already be well out of date.
S-8: We see it in the constant appearance of slang and jargon, of the historical change in languages, in divergence of dialects and the formation of new languages.
S-7: So language is not so much a creator or shaper of human nature, so much as a window onto human nature.
S-6: In a book that I'm currently working on, I hope to use language to shed light on a number of aspects of human nature, including the cognitive machinery with which humans conceptualize the world and the relationship types that govern human interaction.
S-5: And I'm going to say a few words about each one this morning.

S-4: What happened was that Aveling's mistress was Marx's daughter, and when both Darwin and Marx were dead, Marx's papers became muddled up with Aveling's papers and a letter from Darwin saying, "My dear sir, thank you very much but I don't want you to dedicate your book to me," was mistakenly supposed to be addressed to Marx, and that gave rise to this whole myth, which you've probably heard.

S-7: This long string of numbers and letters here is a unique identifier tied to every single change, but without any central coordination.
S-6: Every Git system generates this number the same way, which means this is a signature tied directly and unforgeably to a particular change.

S-6: 2008, 2009 were heavy years for me for another reason, too.

S-7: Not for the sake of our health, though it's often presented that way, but because it's an escape from the human anthill.

S-6: And that's a lot of the reason why we care so much about our careers and indeed start caring so much about material goods.
S-5: You know, we're often told that we live in very materialistic times, that we're all greedy people.
S-4: I don't think we are particularly materialistic.

S-8: The universe is much bigger than our prophet said, grander, more subtle, more elegant?' Instead they say, 'No, no, no!
S-7: My god is a little god, and I want him to stay that way.' A religion, old or new, that stressed the magnificence of the universe as revealed by modern science might be able to draw forth reserves of reverence and awe hardly tapped by the conventional faiths."
S-6: Now, this is an elite audience, and I would therefore expect about 10 percent of you to be religious.

S-5: And it's obviously got nothing to do with democracy, because in our terms the Chinese certainly don't have a democracy.
S-4: And the reason for this is, firstly, because the state in China is given a very special -- it enjoys a very special significance as the representative, the embodiment and the guardian of Chinese civilization, of the civilization-state.
S-3: This is as close as China gets to a kind of spiritual role.
S-2: And the second reason is because, whereas in Europe and North America, the state's power is continuously challenged -- I mean in the European tradition, historically against the church, against other sectors of the aristocracy, against merchants and so on -- for 1,000 years, the power of the Chinese state has not been challenged.

S-5: We had to grow them in vermi manure, which is sterile, or hydroponics, and take them outdoors every three to four months.
S-4: The second plant is Mother-in-law's Tongue, which is again a very common plant, and we call it a bedroom plant, because it converts CO2 into oxygen at night.
S-3: And we need six to eight waist-high plants per person.
S-2: The third plant is money plant, and this is again a very common plant; preferably grows in hydroponics.

S-7: People write me about their personal experience, and about their examples, and what they disagree, and nuances.
S-6: And even being here -- I mean the last few days, I've known really heights of obsessive behavior I never thought about.
S-5: Which I think is just fascinating.
S-4: I will tell you a little bit about irrational behavior.

S-7: Majority of the physicians now choose to let the patient go to hip replacement.
S-6: I hope this worries you, by the way -- when you go to see your physician.
S-5: The thing is is that no physician would ever say, "Piroxicam, ibuprofen, hip replacement.
S-4: Let's go for hip replacement."
S-3: But the moment you set this as the default it has a huge power over whatever people end up doing.

S-7: Germany is on the left. And Austria is on the right.
S-6: The Netherlands is on the left. And Belgium is on the right.

S-8: EB: And then it has to light up its engines, right itself, and then slowly slow itself down and touch down on the ground safely.
S-7: BC: Earth and Mars are so far apart that it takes over ten minutes for a signal from Mars to get to Earth.
S-6: And EDL itself is all over in a matter of seven minutes.
S-5: So by the time you even hear from the lander that EDL has started it'll already be over.
S-4: EB: We have to build large amounts of autonomy into the spacecraft so that it can land itself safely.
S-3: BC: EDL is this immense, technically challenging problem.
S-2: It's about getting a spacecraft that's hurtling through deep space and using all this bag of tricks to somehow figure out how to get it down to the surface of Mars at zero miles an hour.

S-10: Last year in Florida they found extinct ancestor of a rhinoceros and said, "Seems to have spent most of its time in the water."
S-9: So this is a close connection between nakedness and water.
S-8: As an absolute connection, it only works one way.
S-7: You can't say all aquatic animals are naked, because look at the sea otter.
S-6: But you can say that every animal that has become naked has been conditioned by water, in its own lifetime, or the lifetime of its ancestors. I think this is significant.
S-5: The only exception is the naked Somalian mole-rat, which never puts its nose above the surface of the ground.
S-4: And take bipedality.
S-3: Here you can't find anybody to compare it with, because we're the only animal that walks upright on two legs.
S-2: But you can say this: all the apes and all the monkeys are capable of walking on two legs, if they want to, for a short time.

S-7: But it clearly cools down.
S-6: And one other thing: it's fast.
S-5: It's really important to say. So much of the other things that we ought to do, like slowing emissions, are intrinsically slow, because it takes time to build all the hardware we need to reduce emissions.
S-4: And not only that, when you cut emissions, you don't cut concentrations, because concentrations, the amount of CO2 in the air, is the sum of emissions over time.
