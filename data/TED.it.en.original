S-7: So, the question is how do you go from the mud-hut village, to the more developed city, to the even highly developed Sultanbelyi?
S-6: I say there are two things.
S-5: One is people need a guarantee they won't be evicted.
S-4: That does not necessarily mean property rights, and I would disagree with Hernando de Soto on that question, because property rights create a lot of complications.
S-3: They're most often sold to people, and people then wind up in debt and have to pay back the debt, and sometimes have to sell their property in order to pay back the debt.
S-2: There's a whole variety of other reasons why property rights sometimes don't work in these cases, but they do need security of tenure.

S-8: Francis Collins: So what would you like to say to researchers here in the auditorium and others listening to this?
S-7: What would you say to them both about research on progeria and maybe about other conditions as well?
S-6: SB: Well, research on progeria has come so far in less than 15 years, and that just shows the drive that researchers can have to get this far, and it really means a lot to myself and other kids with progeria, and it shows that if that drive exists, anybody can cure any disease, and hopefully progeria can be cured in the near future, and so we can eliminate those 4,000 diseases that Francis was talking about.

S-1: In fact, as leaders, what we need to learn is that we can influence the quality of that unit of production by creating the conditions for our employees to live their calling.

S-6: You can see that this is a very early step into limits and differential calculus and what happens when you take things to an extreme -- and very small sides and a very large number of sides.
S-5: Very simple example.
S-4: That's a view of the world that we don't usually give people for many, many years after this.
S-3: And yet, that's a really important practical view of the world.
S-2: So one of the roadblocks we have in moving this agenda forward is exams.
S-1: In the end, if we test everyone by hand in exams, it's kind of hard to get the curricula changed to a point where they can use computers during the semesters.
S: And one of the reasons it's so important -- so it's very important to get computers in exams.

S-3: It told us about hormone replacement therapy.

S-7: Those probably made a lot of you in the audience feel very, very disgusted, but if you didn't look, I can tell you about some of the other things that have been shown sort of across the world to make people disgusted, things like feces, urine, blood, rotten flesh.
S-6: These are the sorts of things that it makes sense for us to stay away from, because they might actually contaminate us.
S-5: In fact, just having a diseased appearance or odd sexual acts, these things are also things that give us a lot of disgust.
S-4: Darwin was probably one of the first scientists to systematically investigate the human emotions, and he pointed to the universal nature and the strength of the disgust response.
S-3: This is an anecdote from his travels in South America.
S-2: "In Tierro del Fuego a native touched with his finger some cold preserved meat while I was eating ...
S-1: and plainly showed disgust at its softness, whilst I felt utter disgust at my food being touched by a naked savage — — though his hands did not appear dirty."

S-9: That's the good news.
S-8: The bad news is, this drug doesn't actually treat all cases of cystic fibrosis, and it won't work for Danny, and we're still waiting for that next generation to help him.
S-7: But it took 23 years to get this far. That's too long.
S-6: How do we go faster?
S-5: Well, one way to go faster is to take advantage of technology, and a very important technology that we depend on for all of this is the human genome, the ability to be able to look at a chromosome, to unzip it, to pull out all the DNA, and to be able to then read out the letters in that DNA code, the A's, C's, G's and T's that are our instruction book and the instruction book for all living things, and the cost of doing this, which used to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars, has in the course of the last 10 years fallen faster than Moore's Law, down to the point where it is less than 10,000 dollars today to have your genome sequenced, or mine, and we're headed for the $1,000 genome fairly soon.

S-8: And at the University of Chicago I was a zoology major, and thought I would end up, you know, if I was bright enough, maybe getting a Ph.D. from Cornell in ornithology.
S-7: Then, in the Chicago paper, there was a review of a book called "What is Life?" by the great physicist, Schrodinger.
S-6: And that, of course, had been a question I wanted to know.
S-5: You know, Darwin explained life after it got started, but what was the essence of life?
S-4: And Schrodinger said the essence was information present in our chromosomes, and it had to be present on a molecule. I'd never really thought of molecules before.
S-3: You know chromosomes, but this was a molecule, and somehow all the information was probably present in some digital form. And there was the big question of, how did you copy the information?
S-2: So that was the book. And so, from that moment on, I wanted to be a geneticist -- understand the gene and, through that, understand life.

S-8: They bring us the camera; we make up a contact sheet; they figure out which are the two best pictures; and we now spend six hours teaching them about darkrooms.
S-7: And they blow two of them up, and they have two gorgeous eight-by-10 glossies of meaningful things to them, and we say, "Which one would you like to give up?"
S-6: They say, "I have to give one up?"
S-5: "Oh, yes. We need one as evidence of the class project.
S-4: So you have to give me one. You have to make a choice.
S-3: You get to keep one, and I get to keep one."
S-2: Now, there are two conditions in this experiment.
S-1: In one case, the students are told, "But you know, if you want to change your mind, I'll always have the other one here, and in the next four days, before I actually mail it to headquarters, I'll be glad to" -- -- yeah, "headquarters" -- "I'll be glad to swap it out with you.

S-9: It did not correlate with the size of classrooms.
S-8: It did not correlate with the quality of the infrastructure.
S-7: It did not correlate with the poverty levels. It did not correlate.
S-6: But what happened was that when I administered a questionnaire to each of these schools, with one single question for the teachers -- which was, "Would you like to move to an urban, metropolitan area?" -- 69 percent of them said yes. And as you can see from that, they say yes just a little bit out of Delhi, and they say no when you hit the rich suburbs of Delhi -- because, you know, those are relatively better off areas -- and then from 200 kilometers out of Delhi, the answer is consistently yes.
S-5: I would imagine that a teacher who comes or walks into class every day thinking that, I wish I was in some other school, probably has a deep impact on what happens to the results.
S-4: So it looked as though teacher motivation and teacher migration was a powerfully correlated thing with what was happening in primary schools, as opposed to whether the children have enough to eat, and whether they are packed tightly into classrooms and that sort of thing. It appears that way.
S-3: When you take education and technology, then I find in the literature that, you know, things like websites, collaborative environments -- you've been listening to all that in the morning -- it's always piloted first in the best schools, the best urban schools, and, according to me, biases the result.
S-2: The literature -- one part of it, the scientific literature -- consistently blames ET as being over-hyped and under-performing.
S-1: The teachers always say, well, it's fine, but it's too expensive for what it does.

S-8: Our breakthrough was to create an algorithm that unfolds the cortex, so that we can map the signals closer to its source, and therefore making it capable of working across a mass population.
S-7: The second challenge is the actual device for observing brainwaves.
S-6: EEG measurements typically involve a hairnet with an array of sensors, like the one that you can see here in the photo.

S-8: So in an indirect way, you can see the sun.
S-7: And what they did is they created an integral building element to improve the quality of the space that surrounds the visitors of the museum.
S-6: They created this shade that you can see here, which actually covers the sun, but opens up to the good light from the sky.
S-5: And here you can see how they really crafted a beautiful design process with physical models, with quantitative, as well as qualitative, methods to come to a final solution that is truly integrated and completely holistic with the architecture.
S-4: They allowed themselves a few mistakes along the way.

S-8: And when that doesn't work, when it turns out that people who disagree with us have all the same facts we do and are actually pretty smart, then we move on to a third assumption: they know the truth, and they are deliberately distorting it for their own malevolent purposes.
S-7: So this is a catastrophe.
S-6: This attachment to our own rightness keeps us from preventing mistakes when we absolutely need to and causes us to treat each other terribly.
S-5: But to me, what's most baffling and most tragic about this is that it misses the whole point of being human.
S-4: It's like we want to imagine that our minds are just these perfectly translucent windows and we just gaze out of them and describe the world as it unfolds.

S-2: So, what it does, it has three legs. It's probably difficult to see, but it has a winch and a cable at the top -- and it tries to figure out the best place to put its foot.
S-1: And then once it figures that out in real time, it calculates the force distribution: how much force it needs to exert to the surface so it doesn't tip and doesn't slip.

S-4: Those exposed to the World War II scenario made more interventionist recommendations than the others.
S-3: Just as we cannot ignore the literal meaning of words, we cannot ignore the analogies that are triggered by metaphor.
S-2: Metaphor matters because it opens the door to discovery.

S-8: Shortly after her visit, I was introduced to a nuclear physicist at Mayo named Michael O'Conner, who was a specialist in cardiac imaging, something I had nothing to do with.
S-7: And he happened to tell me about a conference he'd just returned from in Israel, where they were talking about a new type of gamma detector.
S-6: Now gamma imaging has been around for a long time to image the heart, and it had even been tried to image the breast.
S-5: But the problem was that the gamma detectors were these huge, bulky tubes, and they were filled with these scintillating crystals, and you just couldn't get them close enough around the breast to find small tumors.
S-4: But the potential advantage was that gamma rays, unlike X-rays, are not influenced by breast density.
S-3: But this technology could not find tumors when they're small, and finding a small tumor is critical for survival.
S-2: If you can find a tumor when it's less than a centimeter, survival exceeds 90 percent, but drops off rapidly as tumor size increases.
S-1: But Michael told me about a new type of gamma detector that he'd seen, and this is it.

S-9: If you read books of people who climb mountains, difficult mountains, do you think that those books are full of moments of joy and happiness?
S-8: No, they are full of misery.
S-7: In fact, it's all about frostbite and difficulty to walk and difficulty of breathing -- cold, challenging circumstances.

S-8: We may not remember to bring our digital cameras with us wherever we go, but very few of us forget our phones.
S-7: You could even imagine a version of this scenario in which people actually build their own phones.
S-6: Over the course of last year, open-source hardware hackers have come up with multiple models for usable, Linux-based mobile phones, and the Earth Phone could spin off from this kind of project.
S-5: At the other end of the network, there'd be a server for people to send photos and messages to, accessible over the Web, combining a photo-sharing service, social networking platforms and a collaborative filtering system.
S-4: Now, you Web 2.0 folks in the audience know what I'm talking about, but for those of you for whom that last sentence was in a crazy moon language, I mean simply this: the online part of the Earth Witness project would be created by the users, working together and working openly.
S-3: That's enough right there to start to build a compelling chronicle of what's now happening to our planet, but we could do more.
S-2: An Earth Witness site could also serve as a collection spot for all sorts of data about conditions around the planet picked up by environmental sensors that attach to your cell phone.
S-1: Now, you don't see these devices as add-ons for phones yet, but students and engineers around the world have attached atmospheric sensors to bicycles and handheld computers and cheap robots and the backs of pigeons -- that being a project that's actually underway right now at U.C.

S-6: We've slightly lost the habit of doing that, which is, I think, why we're particularly drawn to nature.
S-5: Not for the sake of our health, though it's often presented that way, but because it's an escape from the human anthill.

S-7: But if you probe a bit deeper and get a bit more personal if you will, "Do you favor a law banning interracial marriage?"
S-6: There is a big difference.
S-5: People who don't have neighbors of a different race are about twice as likely to oppose interracial marriage as people who do.
S-4: Just based on who lives in your immediate neighborhood around you.
S-3: And likewise they asked, not in 2000, but in the same survey in 1996, "Would you not vote for a qualified black president?"

S-9: So, I was interested in these two rollers, and I actually wanted more, so I borrowed another mouse from a friend -- never returned to him -- and I now had four rollers.
S-8: Interestingly, what I did with these rollers is, basically, I took them off of these mouses and then put them in one line.
S-7: It had some strings and pulleys and some springs.
S-6: What I got is basically a gesture interface device that actually acts as a motion-sensing device made for two dollars.
S-5: So, here, whatever movement I do in my physical world is actually replicated inside the digital world just using this small device that I made, around eight years back, in 2000.
S-4: Because I was interested in integrating these two worlds, I thought of sticky notes.
S-3: I thought, "Why can I not connect the normal interface of a physical sticky note to the digital world?"
S-2: A message written on a sticky note to my mom on paper can come to an SMS, or maybe a meeting reminder automatically syncs with my digital calendar -- a to-do list that automatically syncs with you.
S-1: But you can also search in the digital world, or maybe you can write a query, saying, "What is Dr. Smith's address?"

S-6: And when it's in their world, they can relate to it and play with it in a way that's fundamentally different from how they play with it on the screen.
S-5: Another important idea is this notion of persistence of character across realities.
S-4: So changes that children make in the real world need to translate to the virtual world.
S-3: So here, Nathan has changed the letter A to the number 2.
S-2: You can imagine maybe these symbols give the characters special powers when it goes into the virtual world.

S-8: It's always reminded me of the Apollo image of the Earth, the blue marble picture, and it's similarly meant to suggest, I think, that we can't really understand it as a whole.

S-9: And the focus when I'm talking about the diarrheal organisms, as well as the focus when I'm talking about any organisms that cause acute infectious disease, is to think about the problem from a germ's point of view, germ's-eye view.
S-8: And in particular, to think about a fundamental idea which I think makes sense out of a tremendous amount of variation in the harmfulness of disease organisms.
S-7: And that idea is that from the germ's-eye point of view, disease organisms have to get from one host to another, and often they have to rely on the well-being of the host to move them to another host.
S-6: But not always.
S-5: Sometimes, you get disease organisms that don't rely on host mobility at all for transmission.
S-4: And when you have that, then evolutionary theory tells us that natural selection will favor the more exploitative, more predator-like organisms.
S-3: So, natural selection will favor organisms that are more likely to cause damage.
S-2: If instead transmission to another host requires host mobility, then we expect that the winners of the competition will be the milder organisms.
S-1: So, if the pathogen doesn't need the host to be healthy and active, and actual selection favors pathogens that take advantage of those hosts, the winners in the competition are those that exploit the hosts for their own reproductive success.
S: But if the host needs to be mobile in order to transmit the pathogen, then it's the benign ones that tend to be the winners.

S-10: And these four types of information -- your optic nerve has about a million fibers in it, and 900,000 of those fibers send these four types of information.
S-9: So we are really duplicating the kind of signals that you have on the optic nerve.
S-8: What you notice here is that these snapshots taken from the output of the retina chip are very sparse, right?
S-7: It doesn't light up green everywhere in the background, only on the edges, and then in the hair, and so on.
S-6: And this is the same thing you see when people compress video to send: they want to make it very sparse, because that file is smaller. And this is what the retina is doing, and it's doing it just with the circuitry, and how this network of neurons that are interacting in there, which we've captured on the chip.
S-5: But the point that I want to make -- I'll show you up here.
S-4: So this image here is going to look like these ones, but here I'll show you that we can reconstruct the image, so, you know, you can almost recognize Kareem in that top part there.

S-9: And I will try and give you a sense of what the ultimate reboot looks like.
S-8: Those three trends are the ability to engineer cells, the ability to engineer tissues, and robots.
S-7: And somehow it will all make sense.
S-6: But anyway, let's start with the economy.
S-5: There's a couple of really big problems that are still sitting there.
S-4: One is leverage.
S-3: And the problem with leverage is it makes the U.S. financial system look like this.
S-2: So, a normal commercial bank has nine to 10 times leverage.
S-1: That means for every dollar you deposit, it loans out about nine or 10.
S: A normal investment bank is not a deposit bank, it's an investment bank; it has 15 to 20 times.

S-6: It's inevitable.
S-5: And can you see that this increase took place without life getting longer and without adding children?
S-4: Religion has very little to do with the number of babies per woman.
S-3: All the religions in the world are fully capable to maintain their values and adapt to this new world.
S-2: And we will be just 10 billion in this world, if the poorest people get out of poverty, their children survive, they get access to family planning.

S-7: The fear has chilled professional interaction so thousands of tragic errors occur because doctors are afraid to speak up: "Are you sure that's the right dosage?"
S-6: Because they're not sure, and they don't want to take legal responsibility.
S-5: Let's go to schools.

S-9: And I have four observations I'd like to share with you today.
S-8: The first is: if society's to make any progress on this issue, we need an honest debate.
S-7: But the trouble is so many people talk so much rubbish about work-life balance.
S-6: All the discussions about flexi-time or dress-down Fridays or paternity leave only serve to mask the core issue, which is that certain job and career choices are fundamentally incompatible with being meaningfully engaged on a day-to-day basis with a young family.
S-5: Now the first step in solving any problem is acknowledging the reality of the situation you're in.
S-4: And the reality of the society that we're in is there are thousands and thousands of people out there leading lives of quiet, screaming desperation, where they work long, hard hours at jobs they hate to enable them to buy things they don't need to impress people they don't like.
S-3: It's my contention that going to work on Friday in jeans and [a] T-shirt isn't really getting to the nub of the issue.
S-2: The second observation I'd like to make is we need to face the truth that governments and corporations aren't going to solve this issue for us.
S-1: We should stop looking outside.
S: It's up to us as individuals to take control and responsibility for the type of lives that we want to lead.

S-9: Between the official story -- the food pyramid -- and the hip locavore vision, you have two versions of how to improve our eating.
S-8: They both get it wrong, though.
S-7: The first at least is populist, and the second is elitist.
S-6: How we got to this place is the history of food in the United States.
S-5: And I'm going to go through that, at least the last hundred years or so, very quickly right now.
S-4: A hundred years ago, guess what?
S-3: Everyone was a locavore: even New York had pig farms nearby, and shipping food all over the place was a ridiculous notion.

S-10: There is no longer any consistency in the surface signals.
S-9: Our breakthrough was to create an algorithm that unfolds the cortex, so that we can map the signals closer to its source, and therefore making it capable of working across a mass population.
S-8: The second challenge is the actual device for observing brainwaves.
S-7: EEG measurements typically involve a hairnet with an array of sensors, like the one that you can see here in the photo.
S-6: A technician will put the electrodes onto the scalp using a conductive gel or paste and usually after a procedure of preparing the scalp by light abrasion.
S-5: Now this is quite time consuming and isn't the most comfortable process.
S-4: And on top of that, these systems actually cost in the tens of thousands of dollars.
S-3: So with that, I'd like to invite onstage Evan Grant, who is one of last year's speakers, who's kindly agreed to help me to demonstrate what we've been able to develop.
S-2: So the device that you see is a 14-channel, high-fidelity EEG acquisition system.

S-7: So, this does not have any sensors.
S-6: So, it's an open loop control.
S-5: For those who probably know, if you don't have any sensors and there are any disturbances, you know what happens.
S-4: So, based on that success, the following year we did the proper mechanical design starting from kinematics.
S-3: And thus, DARwIn I was born in 2005.

S-7: When they opened this one up, they found its stomach was full of plastic.
S-6: And this is really bad news because plastic is not an inert substance.
S-5: It leaches out chemicals into the flesh of the poor critter that ate it, and then we come along and eat that poor critter, and we get some of the toxins accumulating in our bodies as well.

S-7: And this was, incidentally, published in 1949, in the leading textbook of malaria, called "Boyd's Malariology."
S-6: But almost no malaria experts even know it exists.
S-5: This is important, because it tells us that if you have moderate biting densities, you can eradicate malaria by mosquito proofing houses.
S-4: Now, I would suggest that you could do this in a lot of places.
S-3: Like, you know, just as you get into the malaria zone, sub-Saharan Africa.

S-7: So this will be the typical workflow situation.
S-6: The police will decide -- in the evening, when there's a case coming in -- they will decide, okay, is this a case where we need to do an autopsy?
S-5: So in the morning, in between six and seven in the morning, the body is then transported inside of the body bag to our center and is being scanned through one of the CT scanners.
S-4: And then the radiologist, together with the pathologist and sometimes the forensic scientist, looks at the data that's coming out, and they have a joint session.

S-4: Chinese restaurants have done largely the same thing, I would argue, with the menu and the décor -- even the restaurant name -- but without a centralized headquarters.
S-3: So, this actually became very clear to me with the March 30, 2005 Powerball drawing, where, you know, they expected, based on the number of ticket sales they had, to have three or four second-place winners -- those are the people who match five or six Powerball numbers.

S-3: So, the original meaning of "cogito" is to shake together.

S-9: Research into kids' behavior actually suggests that it’s worth taking role-playing seriously.
S-8: Because when children play a role, they actually follow social scripts quite closely that they’ve learnt from us as adults.
S-7: If one kid plays "store," and another one’s playing "house," then the whole kind of play falls down.
S-6: So they get used to quite quickly to understanding the rules for social interactions, and are actually quite quick to point out when they’re broken.
S-5: So when, as adults, we role-play, then we have a huge set of these scripts already internalized.
S-4: We’ve gone through lots of experiences in life, and they provide a strong intuition as to whether an interaction is going to work.
S-3: So we’re very good, when acting out a solution, at spotting whether something lacks authenticity.
S-2: So role-play is actually, I think, quite valuable when it comes to thinking about experiences.

S-4: And surely, somewhere in the universe two black holes have merged.
S-3: And surely, the space around us is ringing after traveling maybe a million light years, or a million years, at the speed of light to get to us.
S-2: But the sound is too quiet for any of us to ever hear.

S-7: And thirdly, changing from a fossil fuel economy to a solar economy.

S-8: One of the things that happens if you spend a lot of time on the Internet, and you spend a lot of time thinking about the Internet, is that it is very easy to fall in love with the Internet.
S-7: It is very easy to fall in love with the decentralized, bottom-up structure of the Internet.
S-6: It is very easy to think that networks are necessarily good things -- that being linked from one place to another, that being tightly linked in a group, is a very good thing.
S-5: And much of the time it is.
S-4: But there's also a downside to this -- a kind of dark side, in fact -- and that is that the more tightly linked we've become to each other, the harder it is for each of us to remain independent.
S-3: One of the fundamental characteristics of a network is that, once you are linked in the network, the network starts to shape your views and starts to shape your interactions with everybody else.

S-10: Well, what does this have to do with language?
S-9: Well, language, as a social interaction, has to satisfy two conditions.
S-8: You have to convey the actual content -- here we get back to the container metaphor.
S-7: You want to express the bribe, the command, the promise, the solicitation and so on, but you also have to negotiate and maintain the kind of relationship you have with the other person.
S-6: The solution, I think, is that we use language at two levels: the literal form signals the safest relationship with the listener, whereas the implicated content -- the reading between the lines that we count on the listener to perform -- allows the listener to derive the interpretation which is most relevant in context, which possibly initiates a changed relationship.
S-5: The simplest example of this is in the polite request.
S-4: If you express your request as a conditional -- "if you could open the window, that would be great" -- even though the content is an imperative, the fact that you're not using the imperative voice means that you're not acting as if you're in a relationship of dominance, where you could presuppose the compliance of the other person.
S-3: On the other hand, you want the damn guacamole.
S-2: By expressing it as an if-then statement, you can get the message across without appearing to boss another person around.
S-1: And in a more subtle way, I think, this works for all of the veiled speech acts involving plausible deniability: the bribes, threats, propositions, solicitations and so on.

S-6: He didn't want cry in front of me, but he knew he wasn't going to make it back to the city, and it was better me than to allow himself to express these feelings and emotions in front of the women.
S-5: And this is a man who, 10 minutes ago, had just put his teenage son in the ground -- something I just can't even imagine.
S-4: The thing that sticks with me the most is that he was apologizing to me for crying in front of me, and at the same time, he was also giving me props, lifting me up, for not crying.

S-7: So I actually developed a proposal to go out with a cargo ship and two decommissioned fishing trawlers, a crane, a chipping machine and a cold-molding machine.
S-6: And my intention was to go out to the gyre, raise awareness about this issue and begin to pick up the plastic, chip it into little bits and cold mold it into bricks that could potentially be used as building materials in underdeveloped communities.
S-5: I began talking with people who actually had been out to the gyre and were studying the plastic problem in the marine environment and upon doing so, I realized actually that cleaning it up would be a very small drop in the bucket relative to how much is being generated every day around the world, and that actually I needed to back up and look at the bigger picture.
S-4: And the bigger picture is: we need to find a way to turn off the faucet.
S-3: We need to cut the spigot of single-use and disposable plastics, which are entering the marine environment every day on a global scale.
S-2: So in looking at that, I also realized that I was really angry.

S-6: And interesting research by Adam Grant at the Wharton School has found that introverted leaders often deliver better outcomes than extroverts do, because when they are managing proactive employees, they're much more likely to let those employees run with their ideas, whereas an extrovert can, quite unwittingly, get so excited about things that they're putting their own stamp on things, and other people's ideas might not as easily then bubble up to the surface.

S-7: We've all, I think, become, sort of computational chauvinists, and think that computation is everything, but the mechanics still matter.
S-6: Here's another robot, the PackBot, that we've been building for a bunch of years.
S-5: It's a military surveillance robot, to go in ahead of troops -- looking at caves, for instance.
S-4: But we had to make it fairly robust, much more robust than the robots we build in our labs.
S-3: On board that robot is a PC running Linux.
S-2: It can withstand a 400G shock. The robot has local intelligence: it can flip itself over, can get itself into communication range, can go upstairs by itself, et cetera.
S-1: Okay, so it's doing local navigation there.
S: A soldier gives it a command to go upstairs, and it does.

S-7: Now, our Sun will not collapse to a black hole -- it's not massive enough -- but there are tens of thousands of black holes in our galaxy.
S-6: And if one were to eclipse the Milky Way, this is what it would look like.
S-5: We would see a shadow of that black hole against the hundred billion stars in the Milky Way Galaxy and its luminous dust lanes.
S-4: And if we were to fall towards this black hole, we would see all of that light lensed around it, and we could even start to cross into that shadow and really not notice that anything dramatic had happened.
S-3: It would be bad if we tried to fire our rockets and get out of there because we couldn't, anymore than light can escape.
S-2: But even though the black hole is dark from the outside, it's not dark on the inside, because all of the light from the galaxy can fall in behind us.
S-1: And even though, due to a relativistic effect known as time dilation, our clocks would seem to slow down relative to galactic time, it would look as though the evolution of the galaxy had been sped up and shot at us, right before we were crushed to death by the black hole.
S: It would be like a near-death experience where you see the light at the end of the tunnel, but it's a total death experience.

S-7: So I took another crack at it -- you've got to keep it moving -- and I Xeroxed some words on pieces of colored paper and I pasted them down on an ugly board.
S-6: I thought that something would come out of it, like "Words rule fantastic new old first last Pope" because it's by Alexander Pope, but I sort of made a mess out of it, and then I thought I'd repeat it in some way so it was legible.
S-5: So, it was going nowhere.
S-4: Sometimes, in the middle of a resistant problem, I write down things that I know about it.
S-3: But you can see the beginning of an idea there, because you can see the word "new" emerging from the "old."
S-2: That's what happens.

S-1: It wasn't a non-profit buried, you know, on the 30th floor of some building downtown. It was right in the neighborhood that it was serving, and it was open all the time to the public.

S-4: But still, even in this age of Google and TripAdvisor and Amazon Recommends, it's still experts that we rely upon most -- especially when the stakes are high and the decision really matters.
S-3: Because in a world of data deluge and extreme complexity, we believe that experts are more able to process information than we can -- that they are able to come to better conclusions than we could come to on our own.
S-2: And in an age that is sometimes nowadays frightening or confusing, we feel reassured by the almost parental-like authority of experts who tell us so clearly what it is we can and cannot do.

S-6: But also here is another idea we have -- is an intercollegiate exchange program where you have students going from New York abroad.
S-5: But frankly there are enough differences within the country now where maybe you can take a bunch of kids from NYU, have them go study for a semester at the University of Arkansas, and vice versa. Do it at the high school level.
S-4: Literally there are people who might be in school in Arkansas or Tennessee and might never interact in a positive affirmative way with someone from another part of the country, or of another racial group.
S-3: I think part of the education variable we talked about before is the networking experience you get when you go to college where you do get a mix of people that you might not interact with otherwise.

S-10: Now, the difficult problem for any theory of biological design is to explain the massive statistical improbability of living things.
S-9: Statistical improbability in the direction of good design -- "complexity" is another word for this.
S-8: The standard creationist argument -- there is only one; they all reduce to this one -- takes off from a statistical improbability.
S-7: Living creatures are too complex to have come about by chance; therefore, they must have had a designer.
S-6: This argument of course, shoots itself in the foot.
S-5: Any designer capable of designing something really complex has to be even more complex himself, and that's before we even start on the other things he's expected to do, like forgive sins, bless marriages, listen to prayers -- favor our side in a war -- -- disapprove of our sex lives and so on.
S-4: Complexity is the problem that any theory of biology has to solve, and you can't solve it by postulating an agent that is even more complex, thereby simply compounding the problem.
S-3: Darwinian natural selection is so stunningly elegant because it solves the problem of explaining complexity in terms of nothing but simplicity.
S-2: Essentially, it does it by providing a smooth ramp of gradual step-by-step increment.
S-1: But here, I only want to make the point that the elegance of Darwinism is corrosive to religion precisely because it is so elegant, so parsimonious, so powerful, so economically powerful.

S-4: Biologists seem to think so.
S-3: Is matter evolvable?
S-2: Now if we answer those questions in reverse order, the third question -- is matter evolvable? -- if we can answer that, then we're going to know how special biology is, and maybe, just maybe, we'll have some idea of what life really is.

S-9: At the moment, Europe depends on importing millions of tons of soy from South America, where its production contributes to global warming, to deforestation, to biodiversity loss, to feed livestock here in Europe.
S-8: At the same time we throw away millions of tons of food waste which we could and should be feeding them.
S-7: If we did that, and fed it to pigs, we would save that amount of carbon.
S-6: If we feed our food waste which is the current government favorite way of getting rid of food waste, to anaerobic digestion, which turns food waste into gas to produce electricity, you save a paltry 448 kilograms of carbon dioxide per ton of food waste. It's much better to feed it to pigs.

S-9: And I'm very happy to report that we're now using a dose of radiation that is equivalent to the effective dose from one digital mammogram.
S-8: And at this low dose, we're continuing this screening study, and this image from three weeks ago in a 67-year-old woman shows a normal digital mammogram, but an MBI image showing an uptake that proved to be a large cancer.
S-7: So this is not just young women that it's benefiting.
S-6: It's also older women with dense tissue.
S-5: And we're now routinely using one-fifth the radiation dose that's used in any other type of gamma technology.
S-4: MBI generates four images per breast.

S-2: It takes a radiologist years of specialty training to become expert in differentiating the normal anatomic detail from the worrisome finding.
S-1: But I suspect even the non-radiologists in the room can find the tumor on the MBI image.

S-8: That is to say, if we can make the basic technology of one or two things work, it will be applicable to a very, very large variety of human conditions, and hence, extendable in both vertical and horizontal directions.
S-7: Part of my interest in this, I have to say, is that I would like to -- how do I put this politely? -- change the way, or maybe eviscerate, the capital structure of the U.S. health care system, which I think is fundamentally broken.

S-5: One of them is from Mr. Einstein, and he says, "Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler."
S-4: And I think that's a very good way of thinking about the problem.
S-3: If you take too much out of something that's simple, you lose function.
S-2: You have to have low cost, but you also have to have a function.

S-7: The generics came in, first in Brazil and elsewhere, and the effect was just dramatic on pricing.
S-6: Today it's less than 50 cents a day.
S-5: And what's interesting is if you look at the price elasticity, if you look at the correlation between these two, as the anti-retrovirals come down, the number of people you can treat goes radically up. And the Clinton Foundation and WHO believe that they can treat three million people worldwide by 2005 -- two million in sub-Saharan Africa.

S-5: Mammography isn't perfect, but it's the only test that's been proven to reduce mortality from breast cancer.
S-4: But this mortality banner is the very sword which mammography's most ardent advocates use to deter innovation.
S-3: Some women who develop breast cancer die from it many years later, and most women, thankfully, survive.

S-6: It flips its body 180 degrees and it swings its leg between the two legs and catches the fall.
S-5: So, that's how it walks. But when you look at us human being, bipedal walking, what you're doing is you're not really using a muscle to lift your leg and walk like a robot. Right?
S-4: What you're doing is you really swing your leg and catch the fall, stand up again, swing your leg and catch the fall.
S-3: You're using your built-in dynamics, the physics of your body, just like a pendulum.

S-6: What became very clear was that, within a few days, the outpouring of information was immense, and we got a complete and powerful picture of what had happened in a way that we never had been able to get before.
S-5: And what you had was a group of essentially unorganized, unconnected writers, video bloggers, etc., who were able to come up with a collective portrait of a disaster that gave us a much better sense of what it was like to actually be there than the mainstream media could give us.

S-6: So within the next few years, we'll be able to turn up the soundtrack a little bit, render the universe in audio.
S-5: But if we detect those earliest moments, it'll bring us that much closer to an understanding of the Big Bang, which brings us that much closer to asking some of the hardest, most elusive, questions.
S-4: If we run the movie of our universe backwards, we know that there was a Big Bang in our past, and we might even hear the cacophonous sound of it, but was our Big Bang the only Big Bang?
S-3: I mean we have to ask, has it happened before?
S-2: Will it happen again?
S-1: I mean, in the spirit of rising to TED's challenge we can ask questions, at least for this last minute, that honestly might evade us forever.

S-8: So, fast forward a few years.

S-5: I sat down one day and wrote two versions of my own obituary, the one that I wanted, a life of adventure, and the one that I was actually heading for which was a nice, normal, pleasant life, but it wasn't where I wanted to be by the end of my life.
S-4: I wanted to live a life that I could be proud of.

S-7: And one of the most fantastic displays that I remember, or at least visually, was a foraging behavior.
S-6: And they had a lot of different techniques that they would use for foraging, but this particular one used vision.

S-4: And I don't know whether they actually saw crab in it, or imagined that one might be, but whatever the case, they would leap off the bottom and go through the water and land right on top of this coral head, and then the web between the arms would completely engulf the coral head, and they would fish out, swim for crabs.

S-4: Programming is a three-way relationship between a programmer, some source code, and the computer it's meant to run on, but computers are such famously inflexible interpreters of instructions that it's extraordinarily difficult to write out a set of instructions that the computer knows how to execute, and that's if one person is writing it.
S-3: Once you get more than one person writing it, it's very easy for any two programmers to overwrite each other's work if they're working on the same file, or to send incompatible instructions that simply causes the computer to choke, and this problem grows larger the more programmers are involved.
S-2: To a first approximation, the problem of managing a large software project is the problem of keeping this social chaos at bay.
