S-10: Until the only things that you have left are these cells here, the output cells, the ones that send the signals to the brain, but because of all that degeneration they aren't sending any signals anymore.
S-9: They aren't getting any input, so the person's brain no longer gets any visual information -- that is, he or she is blind.
S-8: So, a solution to the problem, then, would be to build a device that could mimic the actions of that front-end circuitry and send signals to the retina's output cells, and they can go back to doing their normal job of sending signals to the brain.
S-7: So this is what we've been working on, and this is what our prosthetic does.
S-6: So it consists of two parts, what we call an encoder and a transducer.
S-5: And so the encoder does just what I was saying: it mimics the actions of the front-end circuitry -- so it takes images in and converts them into the retina's code.
S-4: And then the transducer then makes the output cells send the code on up to the brain, and the result is a retinal prosthetic that can produce normal retinal output.
S-3: So a completely blind retina, even one with no front-end circuitry at all, no photoreceptors, can now send out normal signals, signals that the brain can understand.
S-2: So no other device has been able to do this.
S-1: Okay, so I just want to take a sentence or two to say something about the encoder and what it's doing, because it's really the key part and it's sort of interesting and kind of cool.

S-8: But for scientists, also the rings have a special meaning, because we believe they represent, on a small scale, how the Solar System actually formed.
S-7: Some of the scientists believe that the way the Solar System formed, that the Sun when it collapsed and actually created the Sun, a lot of the dust around it created rings and then the particles in those rings accumulated together, and they formed bigger rocks, and then that's how the planets, you know, were formed.
S-6: So, the idea is, by watching Saturn we're actually watching our solar system in real time being formed on a smaller scale, so it's like a test bed for it.

S-1: And this animation, this shows photosynthetic activity over the course of a number of years, and what you can see is that the boundaries of those deserts shift quite a lot, and that raises the question of whether we can intervene at the boundary conditions to halt, or maybe even reverse, desertification.

S-10: Now what would this mean, and how would we do it?
S-9: Well to start to do this, we took a 3D printer and we started to print our beakers and our test tubes on one side and then print the molecule at the same time on the other side and combine them together in what we call reactionware.
S-8: And so by printing the vessel and doing the chemistry at the same time, we may start to access this universal toolkit of chemistry.
S-7: Now what could this mean?
S-6: Well if we can embed biological and chemical networks like a search engine, so if you have a cell that's ill that you need to cure or bacteria that you want to kill, if you have this embedded in your device at the same time, and you do the chemistry, you may be able to make drugs in a new way.
S-5: So how are we doing this in the lab?
S-4: Well it requires software, it requires hardware and it requires chemical inks.
S-3: And so the really cool bit is, the idea is that we want to have a universal set of inks that we put out with the printer, and you download the blueprint, the organic chemistry for that molecule and you make it in the device.
S-2: And so you can make your molecule in the printer using this software.
S-1: So what could this mean?
S: Well, ultimately, it could mean that you could print your own medicine.

S-7: Now, this is not a good social science experiment, so to do it better I did the same experiment as I described to you before.
S-6: A third of the people we passed the sheet, they gave it back to us.
S-5: A third of the people we passed it to, they shredded it, they came to us and said, "Mr. Experimenter, I solved X problems. Give me X dollars."
S-4: A third of the people, when they finished shredding the piece of paper, they came to us and said, "Mr Experimenter, I solved X problems. Give me X tokens."
S-3: We did not pay them with dollars; we paid them with something else.
S-2: And then they took the something else, they walked 12 feet to the side, and exchanged it for dollars.

S-9: And now I have a sort of vested interest: I want to do it for prostate cancer. So, you know, you aren't treated if it's not dangerous.
S-8: But Wigler, besides looking at cancer cells, looked at normal cells, and made a really sort of surprising observation.
S-7: Which is, all of us have about 10 places in our genome where we've lost a gene or gained another one.
S-6: So we're sort of all imperfect. And the question is well, if we're around here, you know, these little losses or gains might not be too bad.
S-5: But if these deletions or amplifications occurred in the wrong gene, maybe we'll feel sick.
S-4: So the first disease he looked at is autism.
S-3: And the reason we looked at autism is we had the money to do it.
S-2: Looking at an individual is about 3,000 dollars. And the parent of a child with Asperger's disease, the high-intelligence autism, had sent his thing to a conventional company; they didn't do it.
S-1: Couldn't do it by conventional genetics, but just scanning it we began to find genes for autism.

S-7: We actually have a fan club for the robot, DARwIn: Dynamic Anthropomorphic Robot with Intelligence.
S-6: As you know, we are very interested in humanoid robot, human walking, so we decided to build a small humanoid robot.
S-5: This was in 2004; at that time, this was something really, really revolutionary.
S-4: This was more of a feasibility study: What kind of motors should we use?
S-3: Is it even possible? What kinds of controls should we do?

S-9: In order to convert this opaque, 90,000 hours of video into something that we could start to see, we use motion analysis to pull out, as we move through space and through time, what we call space-time worms.
S-8: And this has become part of our toolkit for being able to look and see where the activities are in the data, and with it, trace the pattern of, in particular, where my son moved throughout the home, so that we could focus our transcription efforts, all of the speech environment around my son -- all of the words that he heard from myself, my wife, our nanny, and over time, the words he began to produce.
S-7: So with that technology and that data and the ability to, with machine assistance, transcribe speech, we've now transcribed well over seven million words of our home transcripts.
S-6: And with that, let me take you now for a first tour into the data.

S-8: And somehow the idea that one would want to make art for the iPhone, which my friends and I are doing now, is still not reflected in our understanding of what computers are for.
S-7: So, from both directions, there is kind of, I think, a lack of understanding about what it could mean to be an artist who uses the materials of his own day, or her own day, which I think artists are obliged to do, is to really explore the expressive potential of the new tools that we have.
S-6: In my own case, I'm an artist, and I'm really interested in expanding the vocabulary of human action, and basically empowering people through interactivity.
S-5: I want people to discover themselves as actors, as creative actors, by having interactive experiences.

S-6: So should they have continued to carry the goods on the horse carts, on the ground, that they would eventually get there?
S-5: Well, if that had been the case, there would have been no Industrial Revolution.

S-8: And what we're seeing here, these skyscrapers now, are commentary that are linked to content on television.
S-7: Same concept, but looking at communication dynamics in a very different sphere.
S-6: And so fundamentally, rather than, for example, measuring content based on how many people are watching, this gives us the basic data for looking at engagement properties of content.
S-5: And just like we can look at feedback cycles and dynamics in a family, we can now open up the same concepts and look at much larger groups of people.
S-4: This is a subset of data from our database -- just 50,000 out of several million -- and the social graph that connects them through publicly available sources.
S-3: And if you put them on one plain, a second plain is where the content lives.
S-2: So we have the programs and the sporting events and the commercials, and all of the link structures that tie them together make a content graph.

S-5: He lost his money; he lost his power.

S-10: There's no specificity there.
S-9: So they added two additional components.
S-8: The first one is a polyanionic segment, which basically acts as a non-stick backing like the back of a sticker.
S-7: So when those two are together, the molecule is neutral and nothing gets stuck down.
S-6: And the two pieces are then linked by something that can only be cut if you have the right molecular scissors -- for example, the kind of protease enzymes that tumors make.
S-5: So here in this situation, if you make a solution full of this three-part molecule along with the dye, which is shown in green, and you inject it into the vein of someone who has cancer, normal tissue can't cut it.
S-4: The molecule passes through and gets excreted.
S-3: However, in the presence of the tumor, now there are molecular scissors that can break this molecule apart right there at the cleavable site.
S-2: And now, boom, the tumor labels itself and it gets fluorescent.

S-7: And that's not only true in this country, it is true all over the world.
S-6: Bread has migrated to tropical countries, where the middle classes now eat French rolls and hamburgers and where the commuters find bread much more handy to use than rice or cassava.
S-5: So bread has become from a main staple, a source of calories associated with obesity and also a source of modernity, of modern life.
S-4: And the whiter the bread, in many countries, the better it is.
S-3: So this is the story of bread as we know it now.

S-9: And so, as I was thinking about this, I focused on this organism, which is the El Tor biotype of the organism called Vibrio cholerae.
S-8: And that is the species of organism that is responsible for causing cholera.
S-7: And the reason I thought this is a really great organism to look at is that we understand why it's so harmful.
S-6: It's harmful because it produces a toxin, and that toxin is released when the organism gets into our intestinal tract.
S-5: It causes fluid to flow from the cells that line our intestine into the lumen, the internal chamber of our intestine, and then that fluid goes the only way it can, which is out the other end.
S-4: And it flushes out thousands of different other competitors that would otherwise make life difficult for the Vibrios.
S-3: So what happens, if you've got an organism, it produces a lot of toxin.
S-2: After a few days of infection you end up having -- the fecal material really isn't so disgusting as we might imagine.

S-8: And so, Anuj and Acumen have been talking about testing the private sector, because the assumption that the aid establishment has made is that, look, in a country like Tanzania, 80 percent of the population makes less than two dollars a day.
S-7: It costs, at manufacturing point, six dollars to produce these, and it costs the establishment another six dollars to distribute it, so the market price in a free market would be about 12 dollars per net.
S-6: Most people can't afford that, so let's give it away free.
S-5: And we said, "Well, there's another option.
S-4: Let's use the market as the best listening device we have, and understand at what price people would pay for this, so they get the dignity of choice.
S-3: We can start building local distribution, and actually, it can cost the public sector much less."
S-2: And so we came in with a second round of patient capital to A to Z, a loan as well as a grant, so that A to Z could play with pricing and listen to the marketplace, and found a number of things.

S-10: So the principal looks at it and says, 3 percent for 300,000 dollars? Forget it.
S-9: If you took the same technology and piloted it into one of those remote schools, where the score was 30 percent, and, let's say, took that up to 40 percent -- that will be a completely different thing.
S-8: So the relative change that ET, Educational Technology, would make, would be far greater at the bottom of the pyramid than at the top, but we seem to be doing it the other way about.
S-7: So I came to this conclusion that ET should reach the underprivileged first, not the other way about.
S-6: And finally came the question of, how do you tackle teacher perception?
S-5: Whenever you go to a teacher and show them some technology, the teacher's first reaction is, you cannot replace a teacher with a machine -- it's impossible.
S-4: I don't know why it's impossible, but, even for a moment, if you did assume that it's impossible -- I have a quotation from Sir Arthur C. Clarke, the science fiction writer whom I met in Colombo, and he said something which completely solves this problem.
S-3: He said a teacher than can be replaced by a machine, should be.
S-2: So, you know, it puts the teacher into a tough bind, you have to think.
S-1: Anyway, so I'm proposing that an alternative primary education, whatever alternative you want, is required where schools don't exist, where schools are not good enough, where teachers are not available or where teachers are not good enough, for whatever reason.

S-3: So his idea of a natural universe was one in which the air molecules were just spread out evenly everywhere -- the everything molecules.
S-2: But if you're Boltzmann, you know that if you wait long enough, the random fluctuations of those molecules will occasionally bring them into lower entropy configurations.

S-8: So, we are now at the stage where we are creating creatures for our own purposes.
S-7: This is a mouse created by Charles Vacanti of the University of Massachusetts.
S-6: He altered this mouse so that it was genetically engineered to have skin that was less immunoreactive to human skin, put a polymer scaffolding of an ear under it and created an ear that could then be taken off the mouse and transplanted onto a human being.
S-5: Genetic engineering coupled with polymer physiotechnology coupled with xenotransplantation.
S-4: This is where we are in this process.
S-3: Finally, not that long ago, Craig Venter created the first artificial cell, where he took a cell, took a DNA synthesizer, which is a machine, created an artificial genome, put it in a different cell -- the genome was not of the cell he put it in -- and that cell then reproduced as the other cell.
S-2: In other words, that was the first creature in the history of the world that had a computer as its parent -- it did not have an organic parent.

S-4: Model is based on reason.
S-3: That's basically the difference.
S-2: In a primitive and simple world, there's really no reason for a model because feeling is close to reality.

S-8: That's enough right there to start to build a compelling chronicle of what's now happening to our planet, but we could do more.
S-7: An Earth Witness site could also serve as a collection spot for all sorts of data about conditions around the planet picked up by environmental sensors that attach to your cell phone.
S-6: Now, you don't see these devices as add-ons for phones yet, but students and engineers around the world have attached atmospheric sensors to bicycles and handheld computers and cheap robots and the backs of pigeons -- that being a project that's actually underway right now at U.C. Irvine, using bird-mounted sensors as a way of measuring smog-forming pollution.
S-5: It's hardly a stretch to imagine putting the same thing on a phone carried by a person.
S-4: Now, the idea of connecting a sensor to your phone is not new: phone-makers around the world offer phones that sniff for bad breath, or tell you to worry about too much sun exposure.
S-3: Swedish firm Uppsala Biomedical, more seriously, makes a mobile phone add-on that can process blood tests in the field, uploading the data, displaying the results.

S-10: So the next time you type a CAPTCHA, these words that you're typing are actually words that are coming from books that are being digitized that the computer could not recognize.
S-9: And now the reason we have two words nowadays instead of one is because, you see, one of the words is a word that the system just got out of a book, it didn't know what it was, and it's going to present it to you.
S-8: But since it doesn't know the answer for it, it cannot grade it for you.
S-7: So what we do is we give you another word, one for which the system does know the answer.
S-6: We don't tell you which one's which, and we say, please type both.
S-5: And if you type the correct word for the one for which the system already knows the answer, it assumes you are human, and it also gets some confidence that you typed the other word correctly.
S-4: And if we repeat this process to like 10 different people and all of them agree on what the new word is, then we get one more word digitized accurately.
S-3: So this is how the system works.
S-2: And basically, since we released it about three or four years ago, a lot of websites have started switching from the old CAPTCHA where people wasted their time to the new CAPTCHA where people are helping to digitize books.

S: So every time you buy tickets on Ticketmaster, you help to digitize a book.

S-6: And all of a sudden, the basic algorithm of natural selection kind of pops into his head and he says, "Ah, at last, I had a theory with which to work."
S-5: That's in his autobiography.
S-4: About a decade or two ago, a wonderful scholar named Howard Gruber went back and looked at Darwin's notebooks from this period.
S-3: And Darwin kept these copious notebooks where he wrote down every little idea he had, every little hunch.
S-2: And what Gruber found was that Darwin had the full theory of natural selection for months and months and months before he had his alleged epiphany, reading Malthus in October of 1838.

S-6: And Darwin, of course, argued that evolution is a natural state.
S-5: It is a natural state in everything that is alive, including hominids.
S-4: There have actually been 22 species of hominids that have been around, have evolved, have wandered in different places, have gone extinct.
S-3: It is common for hominids to evolve.
S-2: And that's the reason why, as you look at the hominid fossil record, erectus, and heidelbergensis, and floresiensis, and Neanderthals, and Homo sapiens, all overlap.

S-5: The Bhutanese aren't on some aspirational treadmill, constantly focused on what they don't have.

S-3: How many of us here, as TEDsters in the audience, spend more of our time in the bottom half of this equation, in the denominator?

S-8: Here's my little pocket map of where it's all located.
S-7: A bigger one for you to look at.
S-6: But this is it, this is the oil in the world.
S-5: Geologists have a pretty good idea of where the oil is.
S-4: This is about 100 trillion gallons of crude oil still to be developed and produced in the world today.
S-3: Now, that's just one story about oil, and we could end it there and say, "Well, oil's going to last forever because, well, there's just a lot of it."
S-2: But there's actually more to the story than that.
S-1: Oh, by the way, if you think you're very far from some of this oil, 1000 meters below where you're all sitting is one of the largest producing oil fields in the world.

S-10: But what is exactly that stuff that we lose under anesthesia, or when we are in deep, dreamless sleep?
S-9: Well first of all, it is a mind, which is a flow of mental images.
S-8: And of course consider images that can be sensory patterns, visual, such as you're having right now in relation to the stage and me, or auditory images, as you are having now in relation to my words.
S-7: That flow of mental images is mind.
S-6: But there is something else that we are all experiencing in this room.
S-5: We are not passive exhibitors of visual or auditory or tactile images.
S-4: We have selves.
S-3: We have a Me that is automatically present in our minds right now.
S-2: We own our minds.

S-10: All marine mammals use sound for communication to stay in touch.
S-9: So the large baleen whales will produce long, beautiful songs, which are used in reproductive advertisement for male and females, both to find one another and to select a mate.
S-8: And mother and young and closely bonded animals use calls to stay in touch with one another, so sound is really critical for their lives.
S-7: The first thing that got me interested in the sounds of these underwater animals, whose world was so foreign to me, was evidence from captive dolphins that captive dolphins could imitate human sounds.
S-6: And I mentioned I'll use some visual representations of sounds.
S-5: Here's the first example.
S-4: This is a plot of frequency against time -- sort of like musical notation, where the higher notes are up higher and the lower notes are lower, and time goes this way.
S-3: This is a picture of a trainer's whistle, a whistle a trainer will blow to tell a dolphin it's done the right thing and can come get a fish.
S-2: It sounds sort of like "tweeeeeet." Like that.
S-1: This is a calf in captivity making an imitation of that trainer's whistle.

S-9: You can tag pictures of baby animals as happy, or whatever baby animals are to you, and then you can search that database, navigating with your feelings, rather than the keywords that just hint at them.
S-8: Or you could tag Facebook photos with the emotions that you had associated with those memories and then instantly prioritize the streams that catch your attention, just like this.
S-7: Humanizing technology is about taking what's already natural about the human-tech experience and building technology seamlessly in tandem with it.
S-6: As it aligns with our human behaviors, it can allow us to make better sense of what we do and, more importantly, why, creating a big picture out of all the important little details that make up who we are.
S-5: With humanized technology we can monitor the quality of your sleep cycles.
S-4: When our productivity starts to slacken, we can go back to that data and see how we can make more effective balance between work and play.
S-3: Do you know what causes fatigue in you or what brings out your energetic self, what triggers cause you to be depressed or what fun things are going to bring you out of that funk?

S-7: The current health crisis, however, is a little more the work of the evil empire.
S-6: We were told, we were assured, that the more meat and dairy and poultry we ate, the healthier we'd be.
S-5: No. Overconsumption of animals, and of course, junk food, is the problem, along with our paltry consumption of plants.
S-4: Now, there's no time to get into the benefits of eating plants here, but the evidence is that plants -- and I want to make this clear -- it's not the ingredients in plants, it's the plants.
S-3: It's not the beta-carotene, it's the carrot.

S-10: Wouldn't it be really great if the window could flick back the heat into the room if we needed it or flick it away before it came in?
S-9: One of the materials that can do this is a remarkable material, carbon, that has changed its form in this incredibly beautiful reaction where graphite is blasted by a vapor, and when the vaporized carbon condenses, it condenses back into a different form: chickenwire rolled up.
S-8: But this chickenwire carbon, called a carbon nanotube, is a hundred thousand times smaller than the width of one of your hairs.
S-7: It's a thousand times more conductive than copper.
S-6: How is that possible?
S-5: One of the things about working at the nanoscale is things look and act very differently.
S-4: You think of carbon as black.
S-3: Carbon at the nanoscale is actually transparent and flexible.
S-2: And when it's in this form, if I combine it with a polymer and affix it to your window when it's in its colored state, it will reflect away all heat and light, and when it's in its bleached state it will let all the light and heat through and any combination in between.
S-1: To change its state, by the way, takes two volts from a millisecond pulse.
S: And once you've changed its state, it stays there until you change its state again.

S-10: This brings us to the point, which is, it's oftentimes what you do, not how you do it, that is the determining factor.
S-9: This is the difference between being effective -- doing the right things -- and being efficient -- doing things well whether or not they're important.
S-8: You can also do this with grammar.
S-7: I came up with these six sentences after much experimentation.
S-6: Having a native speaker allow you to deconstruct their grammar, by translating these sentences into past, present, future, will show you subject, object, verb, placement of indirect, direct objects, gender and so forth.
S-5: From that point, you can then, if you want to, acquire multiple languages, alternate them so there is no interference.
S-4: We can talk about that if anyone in interested.
S-3: And now I love languages.
S-2: So ballroom dancing, implicit versus explicit -- very important.

S-7: But, I mean it gets more interesting.
S-6: Last year, this group was able to take all the cells off a heart, leaving just the cartilage.
S-5: Then, they sprayed stem cells onto that heart, from a mouse.
S-4: Those stem cells self-organized, and that heart started to beat.
S-3: Life happens.
S-2: This may be one of the ultimate papers.
S-1: This was done in Japan and in the U.S., published at the same time, and it rebooted skin cells into stem cells, last year.

S-9: So, is that sufficient? If we think they should work intuitively, should we go for them?
S-8: Well, in business, that's certainly not the way we would go about it.
S-7: Consider for example transporting goods.
S-6: Before the canals were invented in Britain before the Industrial Revolution, goods used to go on horse carts.
S-5: And then canals were built, and with the same horseman and the same horse, you could carry ten times as much cargo.
S-4: So should they have continued to carry the goods on the horse carts, on the ground, that they would eventually get there?
S-3: Well, if that had been the case, there would have been no Industrial Revolution.
S-2: So why shouldn't we do the same with social policy?
S-1: In technology, we spend so much time experimenting, fine-tuning, getting the absolute cheapest way to do something, so why aren't we doing that with social policy?
S: Well, with experiments, what you can do is answer a simple question.

S-10: Your computer uses this presence of current to represent a one, and the absence of current to represent a zero.
S-9: Now, what's happening is that as transistors are getting smaller and smaller and smaller, they no longer behave like this.
S-8: In fact, they are starting to behave like the device that neurons use to compute, which is called an ion channel.
S-7: And this is a little protein molecule.
S-6: I mean, neurons have thousands of these.
S-5: And it sits in the membrane of the cell and it's got a pore in it.
S-4: And these are individual potassium ions that are flowing through that pore.
S-3: Now, this pore can open and close.
S-2: But, when it's open, because these ions have to line up and flow through, one at a time, you get a kind of sporadic, not steady -- it's a sporadic flow of current.
S-1: And even when you close the pore -- which neurons can do, they can open and close these pores to generate electrical activity -- even when it's closed, because these ions are so small, they can actually sneak through, a few can sneak through at a time.
S: So, what you have is that when the pore is open, you get some current sometimes.

S-7: People now solved seven questions on average.
S-6: Now, it wasn't as if there was a few bad apples -- a few people cheated a lot.
S-5: Instead, what we saw is a lot of people who cheat a little bit.
S-4: Now, in economic theory, cheating is a very simple cost-benefit analysis.

S-2: How much do I stand to gain from cheating?

S-9: But as this ring rotates at about 1,700 rpm -- that's 28 times per second.
S-8: The equator's speed is actually about 60 miles per hour.
S-7: There are four on-board micro-controllers that, each time this ring rotates it, as it passes the rear of the display, it picks up a position signal.
S-6: And from that, the on-board micro-controllers can extrapolate the position of the ring at all points around the revolution and display arbitrary bitmap images and animations.
S-5: But this is really just the beginning.
S-4: In addition to higher resolution versions of this display, my father and I are working on a new patent-pending design for a fully volumetric display using the same phenomenon.
S-3: It achieves this by rotating LEDs about two axes.
S-2: So as you can see here, this is a, eleven-inch diameter circuit board.

S-7: There's often too many people in the meetings, and they're very, very expensive to the organization.
S-6: Companies often think of a one-hour meeting as a one-hour meeting, but that's not true, unless there's only one person in that meeting.
S-5: If there are 10 people in the meeting, it's a 10-hour meeting; it's not a one-hour meeting.
S-4: It's 10 hours of productivity taken from the rest of the organization to have this one one-hour meeting, which probably should have been handled by two or three people talking for a few minutes.
S-3: But instead, there's a long scheduled meeting, because meetings are scheduled the way software works, which is in increments of 15 minutes, or 30 minutes, or an hour.

S-8: And as I think about the mesh and I think about, well, what's driving it, how come it's happening now, I think there's a number of vectors that I want to give you as background.
S-7: One is the recession -- that the recession has caused us to rethink our relationship with the things in our lives relative to the value -- so starting to align the value with the true cost.
S-6: Secondly, population growth and density into cities.
S-5: More people, smaller spaces, less stuff.
S-4: Climate change: we're trying to reduce the stress in our personal lives and in our communities and on the planet.
S-3: Also, there's been this recent distrust of big brands, global big brands, in a bunch of different industries, and that's created an opening.

S-6: He won't call himself an atheist because it's, in principle, impossible to prove a negative, but agnostic on its own might suggest that God's existence was therefore on equal terms of likelihood as his non-existence.
S-5: So, my friend is strictly agnostic about the tooth fairy, but it isn't very likely, is it? Like God.
S-4: Hence the phrase, "tooth fairy agnostic."
S-3: Bertrand Russell made the same point using a hypothetical teapot in orbit about Mars.
S-2: You would strictly have to be agnostic about whether there is a teapot in orbit about Mars, but that doesn't mean you treat the likelihood of its existence as on all fours with its non-existence.

S-6: Now what is extraordinary about this is, what gives China its sense of being China, what gives the Chinese the sense of what it is to be Chinese, comes not from the last hundred years, not from the nation-state period, which is what happened in the West, but from the period, if you like, of the civilization-state.
S-5: I'm thinking here, for example, of customs like ancestral worship, of a very distinctive notion of the state, likewise, a very distinctive notion of the family, social relationships like guanxi, Confucian values and so on.
S-4: These are all things that come from the period of the civilization-state.
S-3: In other words, China, unlike the Western states and most countries in the world, is shaped by its sense of civilization, its existence as a civilization-state, rather than as a nation-state.
S-2: And there's one other thing to add to this, and that is this: Of course we know China's big, huge, demographically and geographically, with a population of 1.3 billion people.

S-8: Programming is a three-way relationship between a programmer, some source code, and the computer it's meant to run on, but computers are such famously inflexible interpreters of instructions that it's extraordinarily difficult to write out a set of instructions that the computer knows how to execute, and that's if one person is writing it.
S-7: Once you get more than one person writing it, it's very easy for any two programmers to overwrite each other's work if they're working on the same file, or to send incompatible instructions that simply causes the computer to choke, and this problem grows larger the more programmers are involved.
S-6: To a first approximation, the problem of managing a large software project is the problem of keeping this social chaos at bay.
S-5: Now, for decades there has been a canonical solution to this problem, which is to use something called a "version control system," and a version control system does what is says on the tin.
S-4: It provides a canonical copy of the software on a server somewhere.
S-3: The only programmers who can change it are people who've specifically been given permission to access it, and they're only allowed to access the sub-section of it that they have permission to change.
S-2: And when people draw diagrams of version control systems, the diagrams always look something like this.

S-4: I lost and got airlifted.
S-3: Awful, really awful.
S-2: It was one of the worst feelings of my life, as I was lifted up on that winch line into the helicopter and looked down at my trusty little boat rolling around in the 20 foot waves and wondering if I would ever see her again.

S-10: And the difficulty of testing our intuition was the big lesson I learned when I went back to the nurses to talk to them.
S-9: So I went back to talk to them and tell them what I found out about removing bandages.
S-8: And I learned two interesting things.
S-7: One was that my favorite nurse, Ettie, told me that I did not take her pain into consideration.
S-6: She said, "Of course, you know, it was very painful for you.
S-5: But think about me as a nurse, taking, removing the bandages of somebody I liked, and had to do it repeatedly over a long period of time.
S-4: Creating so much torture was not something that was good for me, too."
S-3: And she said maybe part of the reason was it was difficult for her.
S-2: But it was actually more interesting than that, because she said, "I did not think that your intuition was right.
S-1: I felt my intuition was correct."
S: So, if you think about all of your intuitions, it's very hard to believe that your intuition is wrong.

S-7: And it basically shows the percentage of people who indicated they would be interested in giving their organs to donation.
S-6: And these are different countries in Europe. And you basically see two types of countries: countries on the right, that seem to be giving a lot; and countries on the left that seem to giving very little, or much less.
S-5: The question is, why? Why do some countries give a lot and some countries give a little?
S-4: When you ask people this question, they usually think that it has to be something about culture.
S-3: Right? How much do you care about people?
S-2: Giving your organs to somebody else is probably about how much you care about society, how linked you are.
S-1: Or maybe it is about religion.

S-10: So, I'm going to begin by applying this idea to diarrheal diseases.
S-9: Diarrheal disease organisms get transmitted in basically three ways.
S-8: They can be transmitted from person-to-person contact, person-to-food-then-to-person contact, when somebody eats contaminated food, or they can be transmitted through the water.
S-7: And when they're transmitted through the water, unlike the first two modes of transmission, these pathogens don't rely on a healthy host for transmission.
S-6: A person can be sick in bed and still infect tens, even hundreds of other individuals.
S-5: To sort of illustrate that, this diagram emphasizes that if you've got a sick person in bed, somebody's going to be taking out the contaminated materials.
S-4: They're going to wash those contaminated materials, and then the water may move into sources of drinking water.
S-3: People will come in to those places where you've got contaminated drinking water, bring things back to the family, may drink right at that point.
S-2: The whole point is that a person who can't move can still infect many other individuals.
S-1: And so, the theory tells us that when diarrheal disease organisms are transported by water, we expect them to be more predator-like, more harmful.
S: And you can test these ideas.

S-10: Put yourself in the position of the kidnapper wanting to bribe the officer.
S-9: There's a high stakes in the two possibilities of having a dishonest officer or an honest officer.
S-8: If you don't bribe the officer, then you will get a traffic ticket -- or, as is the case of "Fargo," worse -- whether the honest officer is honest or dishonest.
S-7: Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
S-6: In that case, the consequences are rather severe.
S-5: On the other hand, if you extend the bribe, if the officer is dishonest, you get a huge payoff of going free.
S-4: If the officer is honest, you get a huge penalty of being arrested for bribery.
S-3: So this is a rather fraught situation.
S-2: On the other hand, with indirect language, if you issue a veiled bribe, then the dishonest officer could interpret it as a bribe, in which case you get the payoff of going free.
S-1: The honest officer can't hold you to it as being a bribe, and therefore, you get the nuisance of the traffic ticket.
S: So you get the best of both worlds.

S-7: It's raining like crazy here.
S-6: So this rainwater is flooding down the hillside, carrying with it sediments from the construction site, smothering the coral and killing it.
S-5: And fertilizers and pesticides are flowing into the bay from the golf course -- the pesticides killing all the larvae and little animals, fertilizer creating this beautiful plankton bloom -- and there's your pea soup.

S-9: One big clue we have is that the universe is changing with time.
S-8: If you looked at one of these galaxies and measured its velocity, it would be moving away from you.
S-7: And if you look at a galaxy even farther away, it would be moving away faster.
S-6: So we say the universe is expanding.
S-5: What that means, of course, is that, in the past, things were closer together.
S-4: In the past, the universe was more dense, and it was also hotter.
S-3: If you squeeze things together, the temperature goes up.
S-2: That kind of makes sense to us.
S-1: The thing that doesn't make sense to us as much is that the universe, at early times, near the Big Bang, was also very, very smooth.

S-10: So here is a picture of the high seas as seen from above -- that area in the darker blue.
S-9: To me, as an international lawyer, this scared me far more than any of the creatures or the monsters we may have seen, for it belies the notion that you can actually protect the ocean, the global ocean, that provides us all with carbon storage, with heat storage, with oxygen, if you can only protect 36 percent.
S-8: This is indeed the true heart of the planet.
S-7: Some of the problems that we have to confront are that the current international laws -- for example, shipping -- provide more protection to the areas closest to shore.
S-6: For example, garbage discharge, something you would think just simply goes away, but the laws regulating ship discharge of garbage actually get weaker the further you are from shore.
S-5: As a result, we have garbage patches the size of twice-Texas.
S-4: It's unbelievable.
S-3: We used to think the solution to pollution was dilution, but that has proved to be no longer the case.
S-2: So what we have learned from social scientists and economists like Elinor Ostrom, who are studying the phenomenon of management of the commons on a local scale, is that there are certain prerequisites that you can put into place that enable you to manage and access open space for the good of one and all.

I was in large data centers that use as much power as the cities in which they sit, and I visited places like this, 60 Hudson Street in New York, which is one of the buildings in the world, one of a very short list of buildings, about a dozen buildings, where more networks of the Internet connect to each other than anywhere else.
S-9: And that connection is an unequivocally physical process.
S-8: It's about the router of one network, a Facebook or a Google or a B.T. or a Comcast or a Time Warner, whatever it is, connecting with usually a yellow fiber-optic cable up into the ceiling and down into the router of another network, and that's unequivocally physical, and it's surprisingly intimate.
S-7: A building like 60 Hudson, and a dozen or so others, has 10 times more networks connecting within it than the next tier of buildings.
S-6: There's a very short list of these places.
S-5: And 60 Hudson in particular is interesting because it's home to about a half a dozen very important networks, which are the networks which serve the undersea cables that travel underneath the ocean that connect Europe and America and connect all of us.
S-4: And it's those cables in particular that I want to focus on.
S-3: If the Internet is a global phenomenon, if we live in a global village, it's because there are cables underneath the ocean, cables like this.

S-8: That set me on the road to examining biomechanics.
S-7: So here are the new rules of swimming, if any of you are afraid of swimming, or not good at it.
S-6: The first is, forget about kicking. Very counterintuitive.
S-5: So it turns out that propulsion isn't really the problem.
S-4: Kicking harder doesn't solve the problem because the average swimmer only transfers about three percent of their energy expenditure into forward motion.
S-3: The problem is hydrodynamics.
S-2: So what you want to focus on instead is allowing your lower body to draft behind your upper body, much like a small car behind a big car on the highway.

S-6: Lion bones and tiger bones look exactly the same, and so in a stroke, the lion bone industry is going to wipe out all the tigers.
S-5: So we have a real problem here, no more so than the lions do, the male lions.
S-4: So the 20,000 lion figure that you just saw is actually a red herring, because there may be 3,000 or 4,000 male lions, and they all are actually infected with the same disease.

S-8: And let's now look at how we can use this insight to combat road congestion.
S-7: This is a map of Stockholm, my hometown.
S-6: Now, Stockholm is a medium-sized city, roughly two million people, but Stockholm also has lots of water and lots of water means lots of bridges -- narrow bridges, old bridges -- which means lots of road congestion.
S-5: And these red dots show the most congested parts, which are the bridges that lead into the inner city.
S-4: And then someone came up with the idea that, apart from good public transport, apart from spending money on roads, let's try to charge drivers one or two euros at these bottlenecks.
S-3: Now, one or two euros, that isn't really a lot of money, I mean compared to parking charges and running costs, etc., so you would probably expect that car drivers wouldn't really react to this fairly small charge.
S-2: You would be wrong.
S-1: One or two euros was enough to make 20 percent of cars disappear from rush hours.

S-5: Now I immediately knew what he meant.
S-4: Because for me growing up at that time, and our relationship with this man box, "Do you want some?" meant one of two things: sex or drugs -- and we weren't doing drugs.
S-3: Now my box, my card, my man box card, was immediately in jeopardy.

S-7: So an example might be, if you go back 100 years ago when electricity was first becoming common, there were a lot of fears about it.
S-6: I mean, there were people who were afraid to push doorbells, because there was electricity in there, and that was dangerous.
S-5: For us, we're very facile around electricity.
S-4: We change light bulbs without even thinking about it.
S-3: Our model of security around electricity is something we were born into.

S-7: You call your friend, she puts her handset in a robot, and, bam! You're a MeBot -- you can make eye contact, you can talk with your friends, you can move around, you can gesture -- maybe the next best thing to really being there, or is it?
S-6: To explore this question, my student, Siggy Adalgeirsson, did a study where we brought human participants, people, into our lab to do a collaborative task with a remote collaborator.
S-5: The task involved things like looking at a set of objects on the table, discussing them in terms of their importance and relevance to performing a certain task -- this ended up being a survival task -- and then rating them in terms of how valuable and important they thought they were.
S-4: The remote collaborator was an experimenter from our group who used one of three different technologies to interact with the participants.
S-3: The first was just the screen.
S-2: This is just like video conferencing today.

S-7: What is the state of science?
S-6: And, interestingly, complexity is very highly evolved.
S-5: We have a lot of interesting information about what complexity is.
S-4: Simplicity, for reasons that are a little bit obscure, is almost not pursued, at least in the academic world.
S-3: We academics -- I am an academic -- we love complexity.
S-2: You can write papers about complexity, and the nice thing about complexity is it's fundamentally intractable in many ways, so you're not responsible for outcomes.

S-7: And if we want to understand who we are and how we feel and perceive, we really understand what brains are.
S-6: Another thing is sometimes science leads to really big societal benefits and technologies, or businesses, or whatever, that come out of it. And this is one, too, because when we understand how brains work, we're going to be able to build intelligent machines, and I think that's actually a good thing on the whole, and it's going to have tremendous benefits to society, just like a fundamental technology.

S-6: And while those numbers and those statistics are really fun to talk about and they're interesting, to me, Kiva's really about stories.
S-5: It's about retelling the story of the poor, and it's about giving ourselves an opportunity to engage that validates their dignity, validates a partnership relationship, not a relationship that's based on the traditional sort of donor beneficiary weirdness that can happen.

S-6: Because when we're dealing with infectious diseases, we're dealing with living systems.
S-5: We're dealing with living systems; we're dealing with systems that evolve.
S-4: And so if you do something with those systems, they're going to evolve one way or another.
S-3: And all I'm saying is that we need to figure out how they'll evolve, so that -- we need to adjust our interventions to get the most bang for the intervention buck, so that we can get these organisms to evolve in the direction we want them to go.
S-2: So, I don't really have time to talk about those things, but I did want to put them up there, just to give you a sense that there really are solutions to controlling the evolution of harmfulness of some of the nasty pathogens that we're confronted with.
S-1: And this links up with a lot of the other ideas that have been talked about.
S: So, for example, earlier today there was discussion of, how do you really lower sexual transmission of HIV?

S-10: In fact, this material you see is clear and transparent.
S-9: The components of this material are just water and protein.
S-8: So this material is silk.
S-7: So it's kind of different from what we're used to thinking about silk.
S-6: So the question is, how do you reinvent something that has been around for five millennia?
S-5: The process of discovery, generally, is inspired by nature.
S-4: And so we marvel at silk worms -- the silk worm you see here spinning its fiber.
S-3: The silk worm does a remarkable thing: it uses these two ingredients, protein and water, that are in its gland, to make a material that is exceptionally tough for protection -- so comparable to technical fibers like Kevlar.
S-2: And so in the reverse engineering process that we know about, and that we're familiar with, for the textile industry, the textile industry goes and unwinds the cocoon and then weaves glamorous things.
S-1: We want to know how you go from water and protein to this liquid Kevlar, to this natural Kevlar.
S: So the insight is how do you actually reverse engineer this and go from cocoon to gland and get water and protein that is your starting material.

S-9: Both parties know exactly what the speaker means, and the speaker knows the listener knows that the speaker knows that the listener knows, etc., etc.
S-8: So what's going on?
S-7: I think the key idea is that language is a way of negotiating relationships, and human relationships fall into a number of types.
S-6: There's an influential taxonomy by the anthropologist Alan Fiske, in which relationships can be categorized, more or less, into communality, which works on the principle "what's mine is thine, what's thine is mine," the kind of mindset that operates within a family, for example; dominance, whose principle is "don't mess with me;" reciprocity, "you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours;" and sexuality, in the immortal words of Cole Porter, "Let's do it."
S-5: Now, relationship types can be negotiated.
S-4: Even though there are default situations in which one of these mindsets can be applied, they can be stretched and extended.
S-3: For example, communality applies most naturally within family or friends, but it can be used to try to transfer the mentality of sharing to groups that ordinarily would not be disposed to exercise it.
S-2: For example, in brotherhoods, fraternal organizations, sororities, locutions like "the family of man," you try to get people who are not related to use the relationship type that would ordinarily be appropriate to close kin.
S-1: Now, mismatches -- when one person assumes one relationship type, and another assumes a different one -- can be awkward.
S: If you went over and you helped yourself to a shrimp off your boss' plate, for example, that would be an awkward situation.

S-8: Third, personified risks are perceived to be greater than anonymous risks -- so Bin Laden is scarier because he has a name.
S-7: And the fourth is people underestimate risks in situations they do control and overestimate them in situations they don't control.
S-6: So once you take up skydiving or smoking, you downplay the risks.
S-5: If a risk is thrust upon you -- terrorism was a good example -- you'll overplay it because you don't feel like it's in your control.
S-4: There are a bunch of other of these biases, these cognitive biases, that affect our risk decisions.
S-3: There's the availability heuristic, which basically means we estimate the probability of something by how easy it is to bring instances of it to mind.
S-2: So you can imagine how that works.

S-7: How do you get adults to really enjoy wine?
S-6: It's very simple: pour it from an expensive bottle.
S-5: There are now dozens, perhaps hundreds of studies showing that if you believe you're drinking the expensive stuff, it tastes better to you.
S-4: This was recently done with a neuroscientific twist.
S-3: They get people into a fMRI scanner, and while they're lying there, through a tube, they get to sip wine.
S-2: In front of them on a screen is information about the wine.

S-7: If you took the same technology and piloted it into one of those remote schools, where the score was 30 percent, and, let's say, took that up to 40 percent -- that will be a completely different thing.
S-6: So the relative change that ET, Educational Technology, would make, would be far greater at the bottom of the pyramid than at the top, but we seem to be doing it the other way about.
S-5: So I came to this conclusion that ET should reach the underprivileged first, not the other way about.
S-4: And finally came the question of, how do you tackle teacher perception?

S-7: The solution is not going to be more cars, more roads or a new rail system; it can only be found, I believe, in a global network of interconnected solutions.
S-6: Now I know we can develop the technology that's going to make this work, but we've got to be willing to get out there and seek out the solutions -- whether that means vehicle sharing or public transportation or some other way we haven't even thought of yet; our overall transportation-mix and infrastructure must support all the future options.
S-5: We need our best and our brightest to start entertaining this issue.

S-4: And by the way, mass-production -- it is not genetic manipulation.

S-8: So controlling stuff with your mind is pretty cool.

S-7: So let me show you, and I'm going to start with the standard method first.
S-6: So you can see that it's pretty limited, and because the firing patterns aren't in the right code, they're very limited in what they can tell you about what's out there. So you can see that there's something there, but it's not so clear what that something is, and this just sort of circles back to what I was saying in the beginning, that with the standard method, patients can see high-contrast edges, they can see light, but it doesn't easily go further than that. So what was the image? It was a baby's face.
S-5: So what about with our approach, adding the code? And you can see that it's much better. Not only can you tell that it's a baby's face, but you can tell that it's this baby's face, which is a really challenging task.
S-4: So on the left is the encoder alone, and on the right is from an actual blind retina, so the encoder and the transducer.

S-5: And there are some people who say that the world population is growing like this -- three billion in 1960, seven billion just last year -- and it will continue to grow because there are religions that stop women from having few babies, and it may continue like this.
S-4: To what extent are these people right?

S-2: But I suspect even the non-radiologists in the room can find the tumor on the MBI image.
S-1: But this is why MBI is so potentially disruptive -- it's as accurate as MRI, it's far less complex to interpret, and it's a fraction of the cost.

S-7: Because you still have 80 percent of the traffic.
S-6: Now, that's also wrong, because traffic happens to be a nonlinear phenomenon, meaning that once you reach above a certain capacity threshold then congestion starts to increase really, really rapidly.
S-5: But fortunately, it also works the other way around.
S-4: If you can reduce traffic even somewhat, then congestion will go down much faster than you might think.

S-7: And yet, what behavioral economics shows time after time after time is in human behavioral and behavioral change there's a very, very strong disproportionality at work, that actually what changes our behavior and what changes our attitude to things is not actually proportionate to the degree of expense entailed, or the degree of force that's applied.
S-6: But everything about institutions makes them uncomfortable with that disproportionality.
S-5: So what happens in an institution is the very person who has the power to solve the problem also has a very, very large budget.

S-8: So one thing we can do is live longer.
S-7: And nobody knows how hard that is, but we'll probably find out in a few years.
S-6: You see, there's two forks in the road. We know that people live twice as long as chimpanzees almost, and nobody lives more than 120 years, for reasons that aren't very well understood.
S-5: But lots of people now live to 90 or 100, unless they shake hands too much or something like that.

S-2: And as I said, we don't know how hard that is. It might be -- after all, most other mammals live half as long as the chimpanzee, so we're sort of three and a half or four times, have four times the longevity of most mammals. And in the case of the primates, we have almost the same genes. We only differ from chimpanzees, in the present state of knowledge, which is absolute hogwash, maybe by just a few hundred genes.

S-8: He eventually enlisted the help of this amazing other figure, who's kind of the other protagonist of the book -- this guy, Henry Whitehead, who was a local minister, who was not at all a man of science, but was incredibly socially connected; he knew everybody in the neighborhood.
S-7: And he managed to track down, Whitehead did, many of the cases of people who had drunk water from the pump, or who hadn't drunk water from the pump.
S-6: And eventually Snow made a map of the outbreak.
S-5: He found increasingly that people who drank from the pump were getting sick.
S-4: People who hadn't drunk from the pump were not getting sick.
S-3: And he thought about representing that as a kind of a table of statistics of people living in different neighborhoods, people who hadn't, you know, percentages of people who hadn't, but eventually he hit upon the idea that what he needed was something that you could see.
S-2: Something that would take in a sense a higher-level view of all this activity that had been happening in the neighborhood.

S-4: Now, in response to this new use of culture using digital technologies, the law has not greeted this Sousa revival with very much common sense.
S-3: Instead, the architecture of copyright law and the architecture of digital technologies, as they interact, have produced the presumption that these activities are illegal.
S-2: Because if copyright law at its core regulates something called copies, then in the digital world the one fact we can't escape is that every single use of culture produces a copy.

S-5: And this was, incidentally, published in 1949, in the leading textbook of malaria, called "Boyd's Malariology."
S-4: But almost no malaria experts even know it exists.

S-9: So, this is very encouraging, it suggests that something that we might want to do anyhow, if we had enough money, could actually give us a much bigger bang for the buck.
S-8: It would make these organisms evolve to mildness, so that even though people might be getting infected, they'd be infected with mild strains.
S-7: It wouldn't be causing severe disease.
S-6: But there's another really interesting aspect of this, and this is that if you could control the evolution of virulence, evolution of harmfulness, then you should be able to control antibiotic resistance.
S-5: And the idea is very simple.
S-4: If you've got a harmful organism, a high proportion of the people are going to be symptomatic, a high proportion of the people are going to be going to get antibiotics.
S-3: You've got a lot of pressure favoring antibiotic resistance, so you get increased virulence leading to the evolution of increased antibiotic resistance.
S-2: And once you get increased antibiotic resistance, the antibiotics aren't knocking out the harmful strains anymore.

S-6: And then canals were built, and with the same horseman and the same horse, you could carry ten times as much cargo.
S-5: So should they have continued to carry the goods on the horse carts, on the ground, that they would eventually get there?
S-4: Well, if that had been the case, there would have been no Industrial Revolution.
S-3: So why shouldn't we do the same with social policy?
S-2: In technology, we spend so much time experimenting, fine-tuning, getting the absolute cheapest way to do something, so why aren't we doing that with social policy?
S-1: Well, with experiments, what you can do is answer a simple question.
S: Suppose you have 100 dollars to spend on various interventions.

S-9: What you notice here is that these snapshots taken from the output of the retina chip are very sparse, right?
S-8: It doesn't light up green everywhere in the background, only on the edges, and then in the hair, and so on.
S-7: And this is the same thing you see when people compress video to send: they want to make it very sparse, because that file is smaller. And this is what the retina is doing, and it's doing it just with the circuitry, and how this network of neurons that are interacting in there, which we've captured on the chip.
S-6: But the point that I want to make -- I'll show you up here.
S-5: So this image here is going to look like these ones, but here I'll show you that we can reconstruct the image, so, you know, you can almost recognize Kareem in that top part there.
S-4: And so, here you go.
S-3: Yes, so that's the idea.

S-9: And this is why people choose to do work at home, or they might go to the office, but they might go to the office really early in the day, or late at night when no one's around, or they stick around after everyone's left, or they go in on the weekends, or they get work done on the plane, or they get work done in the car or in the train because there are no distractions.
S-8: Now, there are different kinds of distractions, but there aren't the really bad kinds of distractions that I'll talk about in just a minute.
S-7: And this sort of whole phenomenon of having short bursts of time to get things done reminds me of another thing that doesn't work when you're interrupted, and that is sleep.
S-6: I think that sleep and work are very closely related, and it's not just that you can work while you're sleeping and you can sleep while you're working.
S-5: That's not really what I mean.
S-4: I'm talking specifically about the fact that sleep and work are phased-based, or stage-based, events.
S-3: So sleep is about sleep phases, or stages -- some people call them different things.
S-2: There's five of them, and in order to get to the really deep ones, the really meaningful ones, you have to go through the early ones.
S-1: And if you're interrupted while you're going through the early ones -- if someone bumps you in bed, or if there's a sound, or whatever happens -- you don't just pick up where you left off.
S: If you're interrupted and woken up, you have to start again.

S-6: And I had to quit and come and do this thing called A Better Place.
S-5: We then decided to scale it up.
S-4: We went to other countries. As I said we went to Denmark.
S-3: And Denmark set this beautiful policy; it's called the IQ test.
S-2: It's inversely proportional to taxes.
S-1: They put 180 percent tax on gasoline cars and zero tax on zero-emission cars.
S: So if you want to buy a gasoline car in Denmark, it costs you about 60,000 Euros.

S-9: The slum built on the railroad reservation between the sea and the railroad tracks was completely swept away.
S-8: Since this was a high-risk location, the police had warned the residents, and no one was there when the water rose.
S-7: But they had not had any time to evacuate any belongings.
S-6: For hours afterwards, the sea was strewn with bits of wood for miles around -- all of this was from the houses in the slum.
S-5: When the waters subsided, it was as if it had never existed.
S-4: This may seem hard to believe -- unless you've been reading lots and lots of news reports -- but in many places, after the tsunami, villagers were still terrified.
S-3: When what was a tranquil sea swallows up people, homes and long-tail boats -- mercilessly, without warning -- and no one can tell you anything reliable about whether another one is coming, I'm not sure you'd want to calm down either.
S-2: One of the scariest things about the tsunami that I've not seen mentioned is the complete lack of information.
S-1: This may seem minor, but it is terrifying to hear rumor after rumor after rumor that another tidal wave, bigger than the last, will be coming at exactly 1 p.m., or perhaps tonight, or perhaps ...

S-7: And some of them proudly raise their hand and say, "I don't use a car."
S-6: And then I put the really tough question: "How many of you hand-wash your jeans and your bed sheets?"
S-5: And no one raised their hand.

S-7: It was only 200 years ago that we had the advent of the Industrial Revolution.
S-6: And while I'm starting to make some bread for you here, it's very important to understand what that revolution did to us.
S-5: It brought us power. It brought us mechanization, fertilizers.

S-10: So, when the USDA finally acknowledged that it was plants, rather than animals, that made people healthy, they encouraged us, via their overly simplistic food pyramid, to eat five servings of fruits and vegetables a day, along with more carbs.
S-9: What they didn't tell us is that some carbs are better than others, and that plants and whole grains should be supplanting eating junk food.
S-8: But industry lobbyists would never let that happen.
S-7: And guess what?
S-6: Half the people who developed the food pyramid have ties to agribusiness.
S-5: So, instead of substituting plants for animals, our swollen appetites simply became larger, and the most dangerous aspects of them remained unchanged.
S-4: So-called low-fat diets, so-called low-carb diets -- these are not solutions.
S-3: But with lots of intelligent people focusing on whether food is organic or local, or whether we're being nice to animals, the most important issues just aren't being addressed.
S-2: Now, don't get me wrong.
S-1: I like animals, and I don't think it's just fine to industrialize their production and to churn them out like they were wrenches.
