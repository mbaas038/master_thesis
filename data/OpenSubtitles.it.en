S-35: Nowadays editors insist on a controversial title.
S-34: But you should be aware... I'm not an expert, I'm not an art historian.
S-33: I'm certainly not recognized in this field. And more than anything I'm not a member of the artistic establishment.
S-32: It's my intention really just to try and show that the copy itself has worth... in that it leads us to the original and in this way certifies its value.
S-31: And I believe this approach is not only valid in art.
S-30: I was particularly pleased when a reader recently told me... that he found in my work an invitation to self-inquiry... to a better understanding of the self.
S-29: Questions about the concept of originality... have been discussed throughout history... and preceded even the time when the Romans... were selling copies of Egyptian silver artifacts.
S-28: My own favorite story is of Lorenzo de Medici instructing Michelangelo... to carve his statue of Cupid, all'antica... so it would fetch a better price.
S-27: So this concern about originality, the notion of the false and the genuine has always existed... and occupied our ancestors' minds as much as it does ours today.
S-26: The word "original" has itself for us very positive connotations:
S-25: Authentic, genuine, reliable... lasting, possessing an intrinsic value.
S-24: The Latin root "oriri" means "arising" or "being born".
S-23: And I am particularly interested that the word "original" refers to birth.
S-22: I would take the idea to its extreme and draw parallels between reproduction in art... and reproduction in the human race.
S-21: After all, it might be said: We are only the DNA replicas of our ancestors.
S-20: Examining original works is therefore a process of questioning origins, of exploring the foundations of our civilizations.
S-19: Renaissance humanists search into the roots of Western culture, encouraging a wider understanding of cultural heritage.
S-18: This fascination with one's culture's origins is inextricably linked... to the fundamental definition of originality.
S-17: And with originality comes a need for authenticity, the need for cultural confirmation.
S-16: Certifying the authenticity of works can therefore be seen as of fundamental importance.
S-15: The authenticity of an object can be certified according to the following four criteria.
S-14: Firstly, one must consider the form and shape of the artifact.
S-13: Secondly, the material from which it is made.
S-12: Sorry I think that's mine.

S-34: So there must be something pretty special happening in the river tonight and indeed there is.
S-33: This river is tidal but its been crossed by a barrage.
S-32: However at particularly high tides the water flows over the barrage.
S-31: And that is the moment that all these crocodiles are waiting for.
S-30: With the salt water come fish.
S-29: Mullet have been waiting for weeks to migrate up the river to breed.
S-28: This high tide is their first chance to cross the barrage.
S-27: And the crocodiles are waiting for them.
S-26: Remember its now pitch dark.
S-25: Our infrared cameras give us a clear view but the crocodiles can see virtually nothing.
S-24: So they wait with open jaws ready to snap them shut at the first touch of a fish.
S-23: Normally saltwater crocodiles would not tolerate being so close to each other.
S-22: They do compete for the best fishing spots but their disputes are settled with the minimum of fuss.
S-21: The fish keep coming for over an hour but as the tide starts to fall so their numbers dwindle.
S-20: With so many crocodiles competing some inevitably go hungry.
S-19: But for those that stay around there will be a second bite to this particular cherry.
S-18: The next high tide comes during the day and brings yet more fish.
S-17: The crocodiles can now see the fish but that doesnt seem to make them any easier to catch.
S-16: These skilful hunters are surely dramatic proof that reptiles are certainly not simple-minded creatures.
S-15: Theyve predicted the time of the arrival of the fish with astonishing accuracy and they have worked out just what they have to do to catch them.
S-14: They have also managed to suppress their normal antagonism to one another so that they can all take advantage of this bonanza.
S-13: The more we learn about crocodiles the more we realise what complex creatures they are.
S-12: Despite what you might think crocodilians are among the most talkative of reptiles and amphibians.
S-11: Indeed theyre second only to the frogs in the variety of noises that they make.
S-10: The most impressive of sounds of all come from the American alligator.
S-9: When the breeding season starts the males begin to proclaim their ownership of territories.
S-8: The vibrations in his body are so powerful they make the water dance along his back.
S-7: Sound travels through water even better than it does through air and he can be heard by other alligators hundreds of metres away.
S-6: This is a clear statement of ownership of territory.
S-5: Thats fine when he does it lying in his own patch but watch what happens when he bellows close to another male.
S-4: But the rivals dont come to blows.
S-3: They sort out their differences with gestures.

S-30: The tiny male watches as she retrieves her catch.
S-29: Spider silk is as stretchy as elastic, but harder to snap than steel.
S-28: As day turns to night and the forest plunges into darkness, nocturnal predators are coming out to hunt.
