S-34: And this just one day after that same officer directed her detectives to stop investigating two hispanic suspects to focus on my client, the only African-American employee of Vela mortgage.
S-33: Your honor, the court must draw the line and remind the police that lieutenant Gonzales' toxic bigotry has no place in law enforcement.
S-32: - Your honor, Mr. spicer is asking the court to engage in wild speculation based on a cut-and-paste hack job created to portray lieutenant Gonzales and the L.A.P.D. In the worst possible light.

S-25: In May, Professor McLaren was mandated by the World Anti-Doping Agency with respect to the allegations made by the former director of the WADA-accredited Moscow laboratory, Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov.
S-24: The investigation has established the findings set out in the report beyond a reasonable doubt.
S-23: Our experts were to determine if samples had scratches and marks on the inside of the bottle caps, representative of a tool used to open the cap.
S-22: Of the set of samples suspected of being swapped... we were able to confirm... 100% had evidence of tampering.
S-21: We've conducted cyber and forensic analysis, secured data from hard drives, and reviewed thousands of pages of documents.
S-20: The Moscow laboratory operated for the protection of doped Russian athletes within a state-directed, fail-safe system.
S-19: Ministry of Sport, Deputy Minister of Sport Yuri Nagornykh, RUSADA, that's the anti-doping agency in Russia, and the former director of the Moscow testing laboratory were all involved in this operation with the active participation and assistance of the Russian Federal Security Service, formerly known as the KGB.
S-18: The FSB, who had access to the Sochi lab under the guise of the building maintenance contractor, can be identified in the evidence we have.
S-17: Alex Mihailovich, RT.
S-16: Rodchenkov himself is a person who's under investigation in Russia currently.
S-15: He took off from Russia.
S-14: He seems to be a character that you really can't rely on, and a lot of this relies on Rodchenkov.
S-13: Does this compromise your work?
S-12: He is a person in this investigation, but not the only person in this investigation.
S-11: I can say without a doubt, Dr. Rodchenkov is telling the truth and was a truthful witness.
S-10: I was able to corroborate that because of all the scientific and forensic information.
S-9: My team can demonstrate the existence of this system beyond a reasonable doubt.
S-8: It was clear from Richard McLaren's report that was contained in our independent commission, it's proven that offenses were committed.
S-7: So, I don't think anybody can accuse us of sitting back and doing nothing.
